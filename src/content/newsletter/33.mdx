**What a start to the year! üò±ü§¢**

Can you believe it has already been two weeks since I sent my last email and that we're **halfway through January** already?

Time has certainly flown by on my end and, after an amazing Christmas break where I was able to take time off and get some rest, I went back to work and started getting back into my normal routine.

But... just as was settling back in, a **stomach bug caught me completely off-guard**, knocked me out for a few days and drained all the energy I had after my break.

Thankfully I am **feeling a lot better now** and I am nearly back at full pace, just in time for this week's issue, which comes packed with updates and news!

## [‚ÄºÔ∏è New requirements for apps with third-party dependencies](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24)

[In WWDC23, Apple introduced the concept of **Privacy Manifests**](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10060/), which are reports that help apps **identify and define the privacy practices of their dependencies**.

From Spring this year, Apple will require apps that depend on any of the SDKs listed [in their announcement post](http://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/) to include their privacy manifests when submitting builds to App Store Connect.

## [üéâ You can now submit visionOS apps to the App Store!](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/submit?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24)

**Xcode 15.2** was released earlier this week and, for the first time, developers will be able to submit visionOS apps to App Store Connect with it!

It is important to note that Xcode Cloud has also been updated to include **Xcode 15.2** and you can now update your workflows to build and upload visionOS apps. You must note though that, [as stated in the latest Xcode Cloud release notes, test actions are not yet available for visionOS products](https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/release-notes/).

## [üìù Platform-specific release notes with Xcode Cloud](https://www.finnvoorhees.com/words/platform-specific-release-notes-with-xcode-cloud?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24)

Xcode Cloud added support for setting **release notes directly from a workflow during WWDC23**, rendering having to go and update the test notes in App Store Connect after submitting a new build needless.

In this article, [Finn Voorhees](https://twitter.com/finnvoorhees) goes through how this feature works and how you can also provide different release notes for each platform your app supports.

## [üöÄ Scalable iOS CI](https://albertodebortoli.com/2024/01/03/scalable-continuous-integration-for-ios?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24)

I love reading about **real-world examples** and **stories** of CI/CD solutions used by companies of different sizes and requirements.

This time I came across this article from [Alberto de Bortoli](https://twitter.com/albertodebo) on how [Just Eat Takeaway.com](https://twitter.com/JET_technology) leverages AWS, Packer, Terraform and GitHub Actions to manage a CI stack of macOS runners.

## [üéì GitHub Actions certifications](https://github.blog/2024-01-08-github-certifications-are-generally-available?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24)

[GitHub](https://twitter.com/GitHubEng) have recently announced that their Certification program, which was exclusively available to employees and partners up until now, is **accessible to the general public**.

I haven't dived into it yet and there is more information on their announcement post but it certainly looks like a great way to learn more about GitHub Actions and get a certificate you can add to your CV at the end.
