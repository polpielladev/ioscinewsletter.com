## **My WWDC Wishlist**

Hey everyone! I hope you've all had a fantastic couple of weeks. Welcome to another issue of the newsletter!

As WWDC 25 quickly approaches, so do the nerves and excitement about hearing what Apple will unveil at this year's conference.

This statement is especially true for me this year as I will be travelling to Cupertino and, for the first time in my career, [I managed to get a ticket to watch the keynote at Apple Park üò±](https://x.com/polpielladev/status/1923763292629029261).

I am expecting the announcements for the week to be very AI-heavy, and, like everyone else in the community, I have my personal pre-WWDC wishlist:

- First-class Xcode Cloud support for standalone Swift Packages.
- Building and running app targets using Swift Packages only.
- Swift Assist release date, or any other first-party alternative that gets Xcode up to speed with other modern IDEs.
- Ratings resource in the App Store Connect API.
- Improvements to the Translations API with more languages supported.
- More on-device AI APIs.
- Sessions around MLX and more emphasis on running your own on-device ML models.

What are your WWDC wishes? Make sure you share them by replying to this email or by reaching out directly on social media.

Happy reading!

‚Äã[**Tuist**](https://x.com/tuistdev) has introduced a new feature called **Bundle Analysis** to help developers monitor and reduce app size as it grows. This feature allows you to generate **a detailed visual breakdown** of your app bundle, highlighting **duplicate assets**, **unused symbols**, and other inefficiencies that **unnecessarily bloat your app's size**.

Have you ever wanted to create an iOS app **using only Swift Packages**? I certainly did while I was trying to add an example app to a Swift Package library and was immediately frustrated at the fact that **I couldn't do it without an Xcode project** üò≠.

But... do you really need an Xcode project? You might want to check out the tool in this Swift forums post... ü§î

## ‚Äã[**üîê CodeQL now supports Swift 6.1**](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-14-codeql-support-for-swift-6-1-in-version-2-21-2?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_68)‚Äã

CodeQL, the engine that powers [GitHub's Code Scanning feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_68), which **identifies and remediates security issues in your code**, has now **gained support for Swift 6.1**.

Projects built with Swift 6.1 can now be analyzed for security issues and vulnerabilities using version [2.21.2 of CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.21.2?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_68) or higher.

In this newsletter, I usually show you how to automate manual processes using CI/CD, but there are certain times when you can identify issues **before you even push code to your repository**.

This way, you can ensure that CI/CD resources are **reserved for important tasks** and **that costs are kept to a minimum**. Check out this article by [**Noam**](https://x.com/No_Wham) to get started!
