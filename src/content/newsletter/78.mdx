## SwiftLeeds 2025

Hey everyone! I hope you‚Äôve all had a fantastic couple of weeks ‚Äî welcome to another issue of the newsletter!

I have just come back from the **5th edition of SwiftLeeds** and I have to say that it somehow keeps getting better every year. I want to use this opportunity to thank [Adam Rush](https://x.com/Adam9Rush) and the team for organizing such an amazing conference and for having me ‚ù§Ô∏è.

The conference ran super smoothly, the talk show and the talks were great, I was able to catch up with good friends and meet a lot of new people and, in classing SwiftLeeds style, there was a good amount of Karaoke too üé§.

This year I also had the chance to **give a talk on the second day**, which I really enjoyed. I gave my revisited Instruments talk **updated for Xcode 26** where **I diagnosed and fixed some real NowPlaying performance issues live on stage**.

I really enjoy giving this talk at different conferences as it helps bring **the often overlooked power of Instruments to the top of people's minds** through practical examples.

I would like to hear your thoughts: **How familiar are you with instruments? Would you be interested in a performance-focused webinar? **Let me know by replying to this week's issue!

Now, let's dive into today's issue üëÄ...

### [‚Äã‚ö†Ô∏è Don't lose access to the App Store Connect API, sign the new agreement!‚Äã](https://x.com/helm_app/status/1976278173957619804?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_78)

Apple has just revised the **Apple Developer Program License Agreement** to support updated policies and to provide clarification on existing ones.

As you might know, having signed and acknowledged the latest agreement is a requirement to use the App Store Connect API, so if you rely on using it (in [Helm](https://x.com/helm_app) for example üòú), **make sure you sign it before the 23rd of October**.

### [‚Äãüö® CircleCI Xcode version deprecations‚Äã](https://circleci.com/changelog/deprecation-of-eol-xcode-versions?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_78)

Following their Xcode image retention policy, [CircleCI](https://x.com/circleci) will soon be **deprecating a set of Xcode images** that are no longer supported by the platform.

If [CircleCI](https://x.com/circleci) is your CI/CD provider, I would thoroughly encourage you to check out their article and **update your CI if needed** before the Xcode versions are deprecated on the** 7th of November**.

### [üß™ How to test Swift CLIs using GitHub Actions‚Äã](https://www.ioscoffeebreak.com/issue/issue59?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_78)

Swift is a great language to build the tooling that accompanies your app's project. It is **type-safe**, has a **low memory footprint** and, most importantly, it is** a language that you and your team will be familiar with.**

If you have already built a tool and are wondering how to **automate the process of testing it**, you need to check out the latest edition of [Tiago Henriques](https://x.com/tiagodhenriques)' [iOS Coffee Break newsletter](https://www.ioscoffeebreak.com/issue/issue59?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_78).

### [‚Äãüêô GitHub Dependabot upcoming deprecations‚Äã](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-07-upcoming-changes-to-github-dependabot-pull-request-comment-commands?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_78)

GitHub have just announced that several Dependabot-specific pull request comment commands **will be deprecated** in favor of GitHub‚Äôs native pull request features and functionality **on the 27th of January 2026**.

If you use any of the commands listed in the post, make sure you check out the migration guide before the deprecation date.
