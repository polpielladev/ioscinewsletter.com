Hey everyone! I hope you’ve all had a fantastic couple of weeks — welcome to another
issue of the newsletter!

Diving right into the content this time, here's what you can expect from today's newsletter:

- How to optimize your xcodebuild logs for AI agents.
- GitHub Actions workflows for Swift Packages.
- How to improve your SwiftUI app's performance.
- How git hooks can save you unnecessary CI/CD runs.

### [​🤖 How could AI understand Xcode build logs?​​](https://tuist.dev/blog/2025/11/27/teaching-ai-to-read-xcode-builds?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_82)

Have you ever tried scrolling through hundreds — or even thousands — of lines of **xcodebuild output** just to understand what happened in your build?

As [Pedro Piñera](https://x.com/pepicrft) rightly points out in his article on the [Tuist](https://x.com/tuistdev) blog, the **build system speaks a language optimised for machines**, **not for humans or AI agents**. It raises an important question: how could we evolve this in the future to make build output more parseable for both developers and AI?

​[Pedro](https://x.com/pepicrft)’s article is a must-read. He highlights some of the work already happening in this space — including tools like **[xcsift](https://github.com/ldomaradzki/xcsift)** by [Łukasz Domaradzki](https://x.com/ldomaradzki), which I shared back in Issue 77 of the newsletter. It **reformats xcodebuild output** to make it far **more approachable and AI-friendly**.

### [​​💨 [Workshop] How to improve your SwiftUI app's performance with Xcode 26​​​​](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/improve-your-swiftui-apps-performance-with-xcode-26-tickets-1821715834099?aff=oddtdtcreator?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_82)

Have you ever spent hours trying to diagnose **UI hangs or hitches**, or received user feedback about your app feeling sluggish on certain devices? And when you did, did you feel unsure where to even begin?

You’re not alone! I’ve spent much of my career working on products where **performance was critical to their success**, and over time I’ve learned how to track down and fix the subtle — and sometimes not-so-subtle — bottlenecks that make native Apple apps stutter.

Join me next week for an **online workshop** where I’ll share all these techniques and insights!

### [​​​📦 A list of ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflows for Swift Packages​​​​​](https://danielsaidi.com/blog/2025/11/26/improving-swift-package-scripts-with-github-action-workflows?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_82)

Do you maintain a Swift Package and find yourself doing the same **manual**, **repetitive** tasks over and over?

If so, you should definitely check out the **new collection of GitHub Actions workflow examples** that [Daniel Saidi](https://x.com/danielsaidi) has added to his open-source project **Swift Package Scripts**. From **building and testing your package across multiple platforms** to **generating a binary .xcframework**, it’s a great starting point for automating your entire workflow.

Start streamlining your process today!

### [​⏭️ Skip unnecessary CI/CD runs with Git Hooks​​​​​​](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/format-swift-with-a-git-commit-hook?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_82)

While it’s important to ensure your coding style and best practices **are enforced in CI/CD**, running full workflows just to catch formatting issues can be **inefficient** and **costly**.

A better approach is to **handle these checks locally** by setting up **git hooks** that prevent you from pushing code that would otherwise **break your CI/CD workflows**. This creates a much **faster** and more **efficient** feedback loop — like the approach [Keith Harrison](https://x.com/kharrison) shares in his article.
