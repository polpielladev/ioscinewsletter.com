**üó£Ô∏è Conference season is underway!**

Conference season is well and truly underway and what a way to kick it off at [Swift Heroes](https://twitter.com/polpielladev)!

This year's edition of the Turin-based conference was amazing, I attended amazing talks by world-class speakers, met a lot of new friends caught up with friends I hadn't seen in a while and got to know the lovely organisers better.

It was my second time speaking at the conference and I can say the people from Synesthesia always make me feel right at home and I can't wait to be back!

This morning when I woke up I was reflecting on the talks I attended and I have to say there were three that truly stood out to me and that I can't wait to watch back when the videos come out on YouTube:

*   [Alberto de Bortoli](https://twitter.com/albertodebo)'s _Scalable Continuous Integration for iOS._ 
*   [Flora Damiano](https://twitter.com/flora_dam)'s _Crafting Better Icons_
*   [Peter Friese](https://twitter.com/peterfriese)'s _One more thing - How to create insanely great slides using Keynote_.

Keep an eye on [Swift Heroes](https://twitter.com/swiftheroes_it)' social media to know when the videos are available and watch those sessions, they were amazing!

Back home now and time to focus on making [Helm](https://twitter.com/helm_app) even better and preparing the webinar I am giving on Wednesday for [London Tech Leaders and AppCircle about The Future of Mobile Releases](https://london-tech-leaders.webinargeek.com/the-future-of-mobile-app-releases).

## [Why 100+ Companies Are Switching to AppCircle from Microsoft's App Center (Sponsored)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-100-companies-switching-appcircle-from-microsofts-app-3vchc?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2040%26utm_content%3Dapr_21_24)

With the news of App Center's retirement, the search for App Center alternatives has accelerated. In the past month alone, more than 100 companies have switched their processes from Microsfot's App Center to Appcircle.

Check out this post to learn about the reasons why companies are choosing Appcircle as their new mobile DevOps platform and how it can help you with your mobile app development process.

## [üöÄ Using Danger with Swift on CI](https://swiftunwrap.com/article/dangerswift?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2040%26utm_content%3Dapr_21_24)

[Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger) is a tool that runs as part of a CI/CD workflow and allows developers to **automate tasks such as linting code and enforcing name conventions** on their PRs using metadata from their code hosting platform.

The tool is written in Ruby, but did you know it has a Swift counterpart? Check out this article by [JC Pastant](https://twitter.com/pjechris) to learn all about it!

## [üíª Become an Xcode Cloud expert with this 3-hour workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ship-your-apps-faster-with-xcode-cloud-tickets-880727147607)

I have recently announced that I will be running **an online workshop about Xcode Cloud** where not only will I share my knowledge on Apple's CI/CD service, but I will also be **answering any questions you might have**.

Are you considering migrating your app's CI/CD pipelines to Xcode Cloud and don't know where to start? Come to the workshop and I'll give you a **detailed step-by-step guide that fits your needs** and where you can **even reuse some of your CI/CD code**!  

## [ü§ù Ask Apple experts about the review process!](https://developer.apple.com/events/view/upcoming-events?q=app%20review%20consultation?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2040%26utm_content%3Dapr_21_24)

Apple's app review process is one of the biggest points of friction for us Apple developers. If you've been a developer for a while, chances are that you will have had an app version rejected by Apple and have had to either appeal the decision or make some changes to comply with their feedback.

If you've **got questions about the review process** and want to speak to Apple experts, this is your chance! You can book a **30-minute online consultation** and ask them all your questions ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## [üö® Upcoming App Store Connect upload requirements](https://pol.link/xcode-15-requirements?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2040%26utm_content%3Dapr_21_24)

As the date is quickly approaching, I thought it was wise for me to include a reminder in this newsletter that, as of the end of this month (**29th of April**), Apple will **only accept apps built with Xcode 15**.

## [üì± A comparison of top iOS beta app distribution](https://www.instabug.com/blog/comparison-between-top-beta-app-distribution-tools?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2040%26utm_content%3Dapr_21_24)

As I mentioned back in [issue #38](https://www.ioscinewsletter.com/issues/38) of the newsletter, Microsoft have announced that their popular mobile app [distribution service AppCenter is scheduled for retirement on the 31st of March of 2025](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/appcenter/retirement).

I still know many companies use AppCenter, so I thought I would share this great article from [Sherif Abul-Ezz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherief-abul-ezz-36840891/) on the [Instabug](https://twitter.com/Instabug) blog, where they **compare the top iOS beta build distribution services** out there.

## [üìπ Automatically generating release notes using Xcode Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBoBCCV5VQ8?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2040%26utm_content%3Dapr_21_24)

I shared [Wes Chua](https://twitter.com/wescsk)'s free Xcode Cloud course on Youtube back in [issue #30](https://www.ioscinewsletter.com/issues/30) of the newsletter and, this week, I saw that [Wes](https://twitter.com/wescsk) is adding some new videos to the course üéâ.

The latest video in the course shows you how you can **automatically generate release notes** for your TestFlight builds as part of your Xcode Cloud workflows **using CI scripts and a simple git command**!
