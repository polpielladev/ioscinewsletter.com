**üòÖ Better late than never üòÖ**

If you have been a subscriber of this newsletter for some time, you will know that I always (_at least try to_) send new issues on a Sunday evening as I wrap up my week.

Unfortunately, last weekend I was feeling under the weather and I did not have the energy to put the issue together. I am feeling better now though and _they say that it's better late than never_, so I decided to write it and send it this evening instead.

I'll keep it short and sweet for the introduction this time, let's dive right into the content!

## [üíæ How using Tuist cache helped reduce build times by 65%](https://tuist.dev/blog/2024/12/16/trendyol?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2057%26utm_content%3D2024-12-17)

As your app and your team grow over time, it is highly likely that your local and CI/CD **build times will grow too**. For this reason, it is very important to invest time in tooling that supports your needs in the best possible way.

I loved reading this case study article by [Atakan Karslƒ±](https://x.com/AtakanKarsli_) on how [Tuist](https://x.com/tuistdev) cache helped reduce [Trendyol](https://x.com/trendyoltech)'s build times by **65%!**

Nothing says Christmas more than Apple sending their yearly _Get your apps and games ready for the holidays_ post. As always, the App Store will continue to **accept submissions throughout the holiday season**.

One thing you must know in these dates is that Apple advise that, if you have **an important update to ship during this time**, you allow ample time for the review process to complete as it **may take longer for the App Store Review team to check your app between the 20th and the 26th of December**.

## [üöÄ How to make the fastlane developer experience nicer](https://nowham.dev/posts/nicer-fastlane?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2057%26utm_content%3D2024-12-17)

[fastlane](https://x.com/FastlaneTools) is an open source platform that helps mobile developers **simplify and automate their release processes**. Over the years, [fastlane](https://x.com/FastlaneTools) has become **a standard in the community** and it somewhat comes as an expectation these days to use [fastlane](https://x.com/FastlaneTools) to set up CI/CD pipelines for mobile apps.

If you use [fastlane](https://x.com/FastlaneTools) on a regular basis and want to make the development experience a lot better, make sure you check out this article by my good friend [Noam Efergan](https://x.com/No_Wham)!

## [üí¨ GitHub incidents will now have associated dicussions](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-12-11-incidents-will-now-post-in-community-discussions?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2057%26utm_content%3D2024-12-17)

## [‚úÇÔ∏è Find and remove unused code with Periphery](https://adamwulf.me/2024/12/finding-unused-code-with-periphery?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2057%26utm_content%3D2024-12-17)

Continuing on the topic of app build times, one thing that will definitely help you build your apps faster is **deleting code**. The less you have to compile the better right?

If your app has been around for a while, you will be surprised at how much code you are building and shipping to your users that is entirely unused. You should read this article by [Adam Wulf](https://bsky.app/profile/adamwulf.bsky.social) and start using **Periphery** to **detect and remove all unused code from your app**.

When I came across this post, I immediately knew that I wanted to feature it in this week's newsletter. [Natan Rolnik](https://x.com/natanrolnik) has recently added a new feature to **swifttoolkit.dev** that allows users to receive **email updates when new blog posts are published on the site**.

He's teamed up with [Andrew Barba](https://x.com/andrew_barba), the maker of **SwiftCloud**, to build the service behind this feature **completely in Swift** and they have both **released a video showing you how you can build it yourself!**

Gaining insight into the processes and coding practices of a major app is a rare opportunity, and this interview conducted by [Emerge Tools](https://x.com/emergetools)‚Äô own [Josh Cohenzadeh](https://x.com/jshchnz) with [Eric Horacek](https://x.com/EricHoracek) and [Anton Tananaev](https://x.com/AntonTananaev) from OpenAI offers a valuable glimpse into the **development workflows**, **coding strategies**, and **testing philosophies** behind the ChatGPT apps.
