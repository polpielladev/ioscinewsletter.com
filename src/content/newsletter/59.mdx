**üê± A new chapter üê±**

Hey everyone and welcome to the first issue of 2025! Hope you have all had a great end to 2024 and an eve better start to the new year!

I took some time off at the end of the year during the festive period to recharge batteries and make sure that I got some well-deserved rest. I spent time with family, friends and even took a short trip to Scotland to start the year with my fianc√© and her family.

Now that 2025 has kicked off, I am back to work and this week, as I announced [in the last edition of the newsletter](https://www.ioscinewsletter.com/issues/58?utm_campaign=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_content=2024-12-29), I officially joined the Developer Experience team at RevenueCat. I am so excited about this opportunity to work alongside such amazing and talented people and on a product that I am passionate about! ‚ù§Ô∏è

In these two weeks I also launched a brand new section on my website that you can use to ask me any burning iOS CI/CD questions you might have called: [Ask Me A Question](https://www.ioscinewsletter.com/ask-a-question?utm_campaign=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_content=2024-12-29). As soon as I have a few answers recorded I will start sharing them on upcoming issues of the newsletter.

Let's now get into this week's issue!

## [‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Automatically check if a new version of your Swift Package introduces breaking changes](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/swift-api-diff?utm_campaign=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_content=2024-12-29)

As a library mantainer, it is very important that you try to keep new versions **backwards compatible as much as possible** and only ship breaking changes to your users as a last resort.

No matter how hard you try, there is always the possibility that you accidentally break backwards compatibility whenever you ship a new version. If you want to mitigate this risk with a neat automation you can run on CI/CD, check out this article by [Alex Guretzki](https://x.com/goergisn) on the [Adyen](https://x.com/adyen) blog.

## [üß™ Advanced tips to use fastlane like a pro](https://nowham.dev/posts/intermediate_fastlane?utm_campaign=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_content=2024-12-29)

I love reading and sharing these articles from my good friend [Noam Efergan](https://x.com/No_Wham). You can tell that he's really passionate about **tooling and automation** and he's been creating some amazing content on the topic.

This time, he shares some advanced tips you might not have come across before and that will help you to make the most of fastlane.

## [üîê How to work with JSON Web Tokens in Swift](https://swiftonserver.com/2025/jwt-kit?utm_campaign=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_content=2024-12-29)

**JWTs or JSON Web Tokens** are a way to securely transmit information between two parties. They are widely used for **authentication** and **information exchange** during client and server communication.

If you build **CLI tools** that need to access resources such as the **App Store Connect API**, chances are that you are going to have to create or validate JWTs at some point. Worry not because, as [Paul Toffoloni](https://x.com/paultoffy) explains in this article, you can do it **entirely in Swift**.

## [üí™ Struggling to get back into a routine after the break? Check out this article](https://david-smith.org/blog/2025/01/10/accomplish-one-thing?utm_campaign=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_source=ios-ci-newsletter&utm_content=2024-12-29)

This article has nothing to do with iOS CI/CD but I enjoyed reading it so much and it resonates with me on so many levels that I had to share it. After every break, I struggle to get back into the flow of things and immediately feel guilty about not achieving much in a given day.

[David Smith](https://x.com/_DavidSmith) talks exactly about this in this amazing article and how he copes with it with his **_Accomplish One Thing_** rule.

P.S.: This is by far my favourite quote from the article üíØü§©

_Speed is useful, but inertia is powerful._
