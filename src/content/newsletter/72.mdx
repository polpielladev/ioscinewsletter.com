## AI writes code Fast, CI/CD keeps it Safe

Hey everyone! I hope you’ve all had a **fantastic couple of weeks** — welcome to another issue of the newsletter!

As we find ourselves _deep in the era of AI-assisted development_, the way we write code is evolving faster than ever. Tools like **GitHub Copilot**, **ChatGPT**, and **Claude** are enabling developers to generate and ship code at unprecedented speed. What once took _hours_ of meticulous implementation can now be scaffolded in _minutes_ with a well-crafted prompt. On top of that, _vibe coding_ has made it possible for people to bring their ideas to life with **very little hands-on coding**. It’s exciting, empowering — and also a little terrifying.

Because with that speed comes **risk**.

This is something [Hidde](https://x.com/hiddevdploeg) **and** I have been experimenting with in **Helm**, using OpenAI’s **Codex** feature. When we get support tickets we _can’t easily reproduce_, we sometimes spin up a coding agent that attempts to fix the bug and open a PR on our behalf… or at least _tries to_.

These agents will confidently output code that _compiles_ — but not necessarily code that’s _correct_. Which means your **CI/CD setup** is no longer just a _nice-to-have_ — it’s your **safety net**. It’s what catches the **silent regressions**, **unintentional side effects**, and the **sneaky race conditions** introduced by an overly helpful AI. If you don’t have a comprehensive test suite yet, your CI/CD can still be useful by _simply making sure all platforms compile_.

Here's an example of a fix that Codex did for us in Helm. Having CI/CD helps us understand the quality of the changes very quickly:

Once you’ve got that in place — and this is what I’m currently doing with Helm — I’d recommend starting to write **tests for your core functionality**. Not only will it help _guide the LLM_ when it’s generating fixes, but it will also let you **experiment and iterate more confidently**. Let the AI fix it. _If the CI/CD passes — ship it!_

I know that writing tests might often feel like a waste of time, especially for us indie developers as it doesn't have an immediate customer impact, but **believe me it will pay off in the era of AI-assisted** (or more AI-driven 😅) development.

Are you tired of Ruby and Fastlane installation issues? There's got to be a better way! [Discover Codemagic open source CLI tools](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/cli-tools/tree/master?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_72).

It is not a drop-in replacement for all of what Fastlane does (screenshots for example), but we use it at Codemagci to **build and publish iOS and Android apps**, also **versioning** and **device provisioning**.

GitHub recently announced **important updates to hosted macOS runners** that might affect your GitHub Actions workflows.

These updates impact **several runner types** and **Xcode installations**, so make sure you read their announcement to ensure your app is ready for the changes.

In the latest article of [Noam](https://x.com/No_Wham)’s amazing “GitHub Actions to TestFlight – from zero to hero” series, he goes through how you can **automate distribution to TestFlight**.

This article is a must-read if you’re looking to **streamline your release process** and **ship builds to testers with confidence** — all without leaving GitHub.

Last week, I shared the news about Sentry open-sourcing the core functionality behind [Emerge](https://x.com/emergetools)’s **Launch Booster** product. This week, I’m excited to share yet another project they’ve open-sourced since joining [Sentry](https://x.com/getsentry): **Reaper**.

**Reaper** uses runtime analysis to effectively detect unused code in production — making it easier to clean up, slim down your binaries, and ship more maintainable apps. A super exciting tool for anyone working in large Swift codebases! 👻🧹

### ​[✨ How to build delight Swift CLIs](https://swifttoolkit.dev/posts/terminal-utilities?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_72)​

It’s very common to **build small scripts** and **command-line tools** to support your iOS project’s needs — especially when working on CI/CD pipelines.

Building these tools in **Swift** is a great choice: you get **type safety**, **strong performance**, a **small memory footprint**, and — most importantly — **better maintainability** thanks to using a familiar language.

In this piece, [Natan](https://x.com/natanrolnik) shares some must-know tips and tricks to make your Swift tools not just functional, **but delightful to use**!

Installing third-party CLI tools like SwiftLint, Tuist, and Fastlane is common in iOS projects — **but Homebrew’s lack of version pinning and clunky tap system often gets in the way**. Tools like Mint and Mise offer better control, letting teams activate specific versions per project.

In this article, [Alberto](https://x.com/albertodebo) shares how he built a **simple**, **decentralized** approach to managing CLI tools — **no registry**, just **zip downloads** and **per-project version control**.
