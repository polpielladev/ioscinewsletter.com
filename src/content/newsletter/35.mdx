**üöÄ Automating an app's release.**

This week I have completed a task for NowPlaying that I have been wanting to do for a while: **automating the release process**.

We release fairly often and we wanted a quick way to upload builds directly to TestFlight that wouldn't cost us any money and was effortless to set up.

For us, the obvious choice for this was **Xcode Cloud**. Apple's developer membership includes a 25 compute hours per month plan **at no extra cost** and its **integration** and **ease of use** are just brilliant.

Once we settled on a CI/CD solution, we built a workflow that would run when a commit is tagged and perform the following actions:

1.  **Update the project's marketing version number** based on the tag and commit the changes to the repo.
2.  **Archive** the app.
3.  **Upload** the archive to TestFlight.
4.  Add to **all test groups**.

I will soon write an article with more detailed information but thought I would share the solution in case you're looking at doing something similar for your app.

## [üß∞ Compile and distribute your iOS SDK as a pre-compiled xcframework](https://krausefx.com/blog/how-to-automaticallycompile-and-distribute-your-ios-sdk-as-a-pre-compiled-xcframework?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2035%26utm_content%3Dfeb_11_24)

I really enjoyed reading this article by [Felix Krause](https://twitter.com/KrauseFx), the founder of [Fastlane](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools), about how the [ContextSDK](https://twitter.com/context_sdk) library is compiled and distributed as a binary using [CocoaPods](https://twitter.com/CocoaPods).

## [üßê Finding SwiftUI accessibility issues automatically](https://holyswift.app/xcode-15-new-feature-streamlined-accessibility-audits?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2035%26utm_content%3Dfeb_11_24)

Xcode 15 introduced a new XCTest feature that allows developers to **detect accessibility issues automatically** during UI test execution.

If you'd like to learn how to use this new feature to **audit SwiftUI views**, I would recommend reading this great article by [Leonardo Pugliese](https://twitter.com/Leo_Pugliese) üéâ.

## [üö® Changes to App Store Connect upload requirements](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=fxu2qp7b&utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2035%26utm_content%3Dfeb_11_24)

Apple announced earlier this week that, starting on the **29th of April**, any apps uploaded to App Store Connect for iOS 17, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17, or watchOS 10 **must be built with Xcode 15**.

Make sure you make your app build on Xcode 15 if you haven't yet and **update your CI's runners** to build with the same version of Xcode as soon as possible.

## [üÜï GitHub-hosted macOS Sonoma runners are now available!](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-30-github-actions-macos-14-sonoma-is-now-available?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2035%26utm_content%3Dfeb_11_24)

[GitHub](https://twitter.com/GitHubEng) announced towards the end of January that **M1 macOS machines running on Sonoma (macOS 14)** are now publically available to be selected as runners for GitHub Actions workflows.

Note that the **latest** runner is still on **macOS 12** and, for now, you must explicitly select the **M1-based Sonoma** runners with one of the following keys: **macos-14**, **macos-14-large**, **macos-14-xlarge**.

[GitHub](https://twitter.com/GitHubEng)'s Secret Scanning, a tool which warns developers of the **existence of secrets in their codebases**, got an update this week with new supported keys.

The update includes common keys for secrets from popular services such as **Stripe**, **Notion** or **OpenAI**.
