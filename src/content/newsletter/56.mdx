**üöÄ The perfect developer tools bundle üöÄ**

If you have been following my content for a while, you will know that I am passionate about helping mobile developers and teams **improve their developer experience**.

In fact, that is one of the main reasons why I took an interest in the **tooling** and **automation** side of mobile development very early on in my career and a big part of why I started this newsletter.

During my career, I have seen first hand the impact that investing in either developing or purchasing developer tools can have on the **pace** and **quality** of the software you deliver to your users.

For this reason, I have always wanted to make an app that helps developers in the same way other developer tools help me in my day to day.

And so I did! Earlier this year, [Hidde](https://bsky.app/profile/hiddevdploeg.bsky.social) and I decided to join forces and embark on a mission to craft the best possible developer experiences in one of the hardest yet most important parts of the app development process: **shipping your apps**. We created a native **macOS client for App Store Connect** called [Helm](https://bsky.app/profile/helm-app.bsky.social) that has since helped over 5,000 developers ship their apps faster and better!

Today, I am thrilled to announce that we have partnered with [Antoine van der Lee](https://x.com/twannl) to offer you **contingent pricing** for [Helm](https://bsky.app/profile/helm-app.bsky.social) and [RocketSim](https://x.com/rocketsim_app). If you would like to learn more about how contingent pricing works and find out more about how **you can subscribe to both apps in the cheapest way possible**, check out [this article on Antoine's blog](https://www.avanderlee.com/optimization/contingent-pricing-for-in-app-subscriptions/).

## [‚úÇÔ∏è A practical example on how to cut your app's size in half](https://ericsspace.com/articles/how-to-reduce-tpbank-appsize-by-half/)

Have you ever wondered **why an app takes so much space on your phone**? Or are you working an app and want to find a way to optimize its final bundle size?

That's exactly what Tuan Hoang has done. He has taken an app he uses every day and, through some research, has **found a way of cutting its size by half**! Thankfully for us, he has documented the process in this must-read article.

## [üöÄ How to generate authentication tokens for the App Store Connect API using Swift](https://bootstragram.com/blog/jwt-tokens-app-store-connect-api-swift/)

The App Store Connect API requires authentication for its endpoints. Unlike other APIs, where you can simply generate and copy-paste an API key, authenticating with this API involves a more complex process. In this article, [Micka√´l Floc'hlay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickaelflochlay/) provides an excellent guide to generating authentication tokens using Swift.

Alternatively, if you don't want to roll your own solution to communicate with the App Store Connect API, I would recommend you check out [Antoine van der Lee](https://x.com/twannl)'s [appstoreconnect-swift-sdk](https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk) Swift Package, which provides an **authenticated networking client** and **type-safe endpoints generated from the API's OpenAPI spec**. It powers all of Helm's communication with the App Store Connect API and we love it so much that we now help maintain it too!

## [üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Automate memory leak discovery using GitHub Actions](https://www.amanjeet.me/discovering-ios-memory-leaks-part-three/)

Memory leaks are the cause of many mobile app issues in production such as crashes and diagnosing and fixing them can be incredibly hard.

Making sure that those memory leaks that you have put a lot of effort into fixing don't re-appear is incredibly important and, in this article, [Amanjeet Singh Gurtatta](https://x.com/droid_singh) shows you how you can **automatically audit your app for memory leaks using CI/CD**.

## [üöÄ Use Bitrise on Amazon Web Services](https://bitrise.io/blog/post/bitrise-on-aws-benefits-of-using-a-cloud-native-mobile-ci-cd-solution)

[Bitrise](https://x.com/bitrise) have recently announced that they have now added support to use your own **Amazon Web Services** nodes such as **EC2** instances as the underlying infrastructure for [Bitrise](http://x.com/bitrise)'s CI/CD service and use [Bitrise](http://x.com/bitrise) to manage them.

[Bal√°zs Ilsinszki](https://x.com/ilsinszkibal) tells you all about it in this post on [Bitrise](http://x.com/bitrise)'s blog.
