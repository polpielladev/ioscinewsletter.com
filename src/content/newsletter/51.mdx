- Styling the output of Swift executables.

Thanks so much again for subscribing, enjoy the issue!

## [üë®‚Äçüîß Detecting a memory leak in Xcode](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/the-memory-leak-an-xcode-detective-story?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2051%26utm_content%3Dsep_23_24)

At my previous job, I led an initiative to audit the app I worked on to **find all memory leaks** and **fix them**. While the diagnosis is simple in most cases, debugging the root cause of a memory leak can be a **very complex task** that can sometimes take multiple days.

In this article in the [Emerge Tools](https://x.com/emergetools) blog, [Jacob Bartlett](https://x.com/jacobtechtavern) outlines the process he followed to fix a memory leak recently and shows a bunch of tips and tricks you can use in your own apps!

## [üî® Xcode 16 support and major stack updates on Bitrise runners](https://bitrise.io/blog/post/xcode-16-is-now-available-on-bitrise-with-major-stack-updates?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2051%26utm_content%3Dsep_23_24)

[Bitrise](https://x.com/bitrise) has recently announced that a **new Xcode 16 stack** is available on their infrastructure. Along with this new stack come numerous improvements, defaults and updates to the technologies within the stack.

Before you update your pipelines, you must know that **this stack contains breaking changes** and your pipelines will most likely not work out of the box when you migrate.

## [üé® Styling terminal output in Swift executables](https://swifttoolkit.dev/posts/terminal-colors?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2051%26utm_content%3Dsep_23_24)

I was so happy to see this article from [Natan Rolnik](https://x.com/natanrolnik) on [swifttoolkit.dev](https://swifttoolkit.dev) about styling terminal output in Swift executables. It is a topic that really interests me and that [I have spoken about in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBYFHS8jFKk) and seeing more articles about this in the community makes me super happy!

If you'd like to build **delightful Swift CLIs** and style the terminal output to provide the best customer experience possible, make sure you check out [Natan](https://x.com/natanrolnik)'s article! 

## [üß™ Using Traits to annotate and customize test behaviour](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift-testing/using-traits-to-annotate-and-customize-test-behavior?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2051%26utm_content%3Dsep_23_24)

Traits are a feature in Swift Testing that allows you to **categorise and customise** your unit tests. If you'd like to learn all about this feature, make sure you check out [Antoine van der Lee](https://x.com/twannl)'s wonderful article on the topic! 

If you use Xcode Cloud as your CI/CD service, traits such as tags have a repercussion on how your **test reports display** on the dashboard. Make sure you use tags to your advantage to better organise your tests and save time going forward when you inspect failing CI/CD runs!

## [üì± Install older simulator runtimes on CI/CD](https://testableapple.com/install-ios-simulator-runtimes?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2051%26utm_content%3Dsep_23_24)

Using a CI/CD service's infrastructure is a good solution to not have to maintain your own runner infrastructure but it comes with its limitations. For example, you don't have **full control over the software installed in the runners** and are limited to what the service installs on the machines.

There are usually ways to work around these limitations by **installing the software you need as part of the workflow's execution**. In this article, [Alexey Alter-Pesotskiy](https://x.com/testableapple) shows you how you can install simulator runtimes as part of a workflow's execution in several different ways.
