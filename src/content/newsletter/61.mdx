## [üí∞ FREE alternative to App Center build distribution service](https://x.com/emergetools/status/1879597860678951133?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=iosci)

In [March last year](https://www.ioscinewsletter.com/issues/38?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=iosci), I shared the news that Microsoft decided to put App Center into maintenance mode to later retire it on the **31st of March 2025**.

While the date sounded distant at the time, it is only about a month away now. If you are still using Microsoft's build distribution service and are looking for an alternative, this announcement by [Emerge Tools](https://x.com/emergetools) might be interesting to you!

## [üîß Ready to use UI components for Swift CLIs](https://swifttoolkit.dev/posts/noora-package?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=iosci)

New open-source projects like the one discussed in this article make me so happy. I have been an advocate for using [Swift beyond Apple app development for some time now](http://youtube.com/watch?v=LBYFHS8jFKk), and I have been a long-time admirer of the work that [Pedro](https://x.com/pepicrft) and the team over at [Tuist](https://x.com/tuistdev) do in this regard.

Their latest Open Source project Noora is a **ready-to-use design system** and set of **UI components** for Swift CLI applications. This article by [Natan Rolnik](https://x.com/natanrolnik) on [swifttoolkit.dev](https://swifttoolkit.dev/) goes into great detail about what the library offers and how you can incorporate it into your latest Swift CLI.

## [üçé Running Xcode in unsupported macOS versions](https://marcelvoss.com/2025/tricking-xcode-into-running-on-an-unsupported-macos?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=iosci)

If you've been an Apple platforms developer for some time, I am sure the situation described in this article is familiar to you. A new version of macOS launches with some features you are eager to test and, after you finish updating your machine, you realize that **the version of Xcode you are using no longer launches**.

You must be thinking: _well the solution is simple right?_ _You can just update to the latest compatible Xcode version for that macOS version._

Well... while that is true for a lot of cases, some others are not that simple, especially if you work on a large app maintained by numerous developers. If you're in this situation and want to launch **incompatible versions of Xcode on newer macOS versions**, [Marcel Voss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-voss-80679389/) has a solution for you!

## [‚ùì Apple has open-sourced Swift Build: Now what?](https://www.swift.org/blog/the-next-chapter-in-swift-build-technologies?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=iosci)

Last week, we were greeted by a post by [Owen Voorhees](https://x.com/owenvoorhees) on the Swift Blog announcing that Apple is open-sourcing **Swift Build**. **Swift Build** is a powerful and extensible **build engine** that provides a set of build rules for building **Swift projects** and that Xcode itself uses under the hood when building apps and Swift Packages written in Swift.

What does this mean for us developers? How can we make use of this engine? The announcement post does a great job of answering this, but if you are interested in learning more, [I would recommend reading this article](https://tuist.dev/blog/2025/02/03/swift-build) by [Pedro Pi√±era](https://x.com/pepicrft) on the [Tuist](https://x.com/tuistdev) blog.

## BEFORE YOU GO...

I can't believe [we have created 1,000 Helm issues in Linear](https://x.com/helm_app/status/1887445412874707101) in under a year of active development. I guess we've been pretty busy adding new features and improving the overall look and feel of the app üöÄ!
