## Helm 2.0 is here!

Hey everyone! I hope you‚Äôve all had a fantastic couple of weeks ‚Äî welcome to another issue of the newsletter!

Yesterday [Hidde](https://x.com/hiddevdploeg) and I released the iOS and macOS 26 versions of our app [Helm](https://x.com/helm_app). We didn't manage to make day one as we did with our other app [NowPlaying](https://x.com/NowPlayingGold), but we are certainly **very proud of what we have achieved** and taking the extra time to make sure we could make the** update as good as possible** really paid off!

Not only have we embraced the **new Liquid Glass design system**, but we have also focused on **addressing feedback for some of our most important features**, making them better than ever before!

We have made significant enough changes to make this release **our second ever major update: 2.0**!

You can read more about the release in [this update post we have written](https://helm-app.com/changelog/helm-2-0?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_76) and we would love it if you could check out the new version, which is now live on the store and give us a nice review if you enjoy using it ‚≠êÔ∏è.

Now, let's dive into today's issue üëÄ...

### [‚Äã‚öñÔ∏è Is your project ready to scale?‚Äã](https://tuist.dev/blog/2025/09/22/scale?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_76)

Scaling a Swift project isn‚Äôt just about adding more code ‚Äî it often means **slower builds, tangled dependencies**, and frustratingly **long build and test runs**. Many teams hit this wall sooner than they expect, and some even consider drastic moves like **switching frameworks** or **replacing their build system** entirely.

If these problems sound familiar, make sure you read this article by [Pedro Pi√±era](https://x.com/pepicrft) on the [Tuist](https://x.com/tuistdev) blog, there are plenty of tips there!

### [‚Äãüí™ ReleaseTools: A lightweight alternative to Fastlane written entirely in Swift‚Äã](https://elegantchaos.com/2025/09/26/release-tools.html?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_76)

I‚Äôve been a fastlane user for a long time and love **its community support, rich features**, and how quickly you can go from zero to a **working CI/CD pipeline**.

That being said, I‚Äôve never been a fan of Ruby, which fastlane relies on, and I usually end up using just one or two of fastlane's vast amount of features. [Sam Deane](https://mastodon.scot/@elegantchaos) felt the same way, so he built his own solution: **ReleaseTools**, a lightweight and highly focused alternative written entirely in Swift.

### [‚Äãüí™ How to install Xcode 26's Metal Toolchain on CI/CD‚Äã](https://www.polpiella.dev/metal-toolchain-ci-cd?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_76)

We migrated our Xcode Cloud workflows this week to use Xcode 26 and, as we did, we were greeted with an unexpected failure: **The Metal Toolchain was not installed and could not compile the Metal source files**.

As you probably know, the solution locally is to just download the toolchain and build again, but **how do we do that when we don't have access to the build runner**? I tell you all about it in this article!

### [‚Äãüß† Profile your Foundation Models calls in Xcode 26‚Äã](https://artemnovichkov.com/blog/foundation-models-profiling-with-xcode-instruments?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_76)

Are you curious to see **how your Foundation Models are performing under the hood** but struggling to get the right information using logs and print statements?

You definitely need to read this article by [Artem Novichkov](https://x.com/iosartem), who explains one of **the new instruments in Xcode 26 in great detail**.
