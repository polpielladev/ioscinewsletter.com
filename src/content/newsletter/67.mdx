One of the most important things to do when writing CI/CD workflows, is to make sure that you **run as many tasks as possible in parallel**, especially unit tests!

Not only will this have an effect on **the speed of your CI/CD pipeline runs**, but it will also help you **detect flakiness** and **shared state** in your unit tests. Learn how to enable parallel testing for your iOS app with this article by [Noam Efergan](https://x.com/No_Wham).

As of the 1st of May, GitHub have lifted this restriction so that users on the Free plan can now create draft pull request **in any repository, public or private, completely free of charge**.

As mobile engineers, we know that release processes can be time consuming and introduce friction. But have you ever spent time figuring out what the costs and impact for your organization actually are?

â€‹[Gabriel Savit](https://x.com/GabrielSavit), [Runway](https://x.com/RunwayTeam)'s CEO and Co-Founder talks about the concept of a **'Release Tax'** that mobile teams are paying without even realizing it in this LinkedIn post.
