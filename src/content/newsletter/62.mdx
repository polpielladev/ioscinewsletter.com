As you probably know by now, [Hidde](https://x.com/hiddevdploeg) and I are actively working on a native macOS (and soon iOS üëÄ) **App Store Connect client** called [Helm](https://x.com/helm_app). As you can imagine, the app makes extensive use of the **App Store Connect API** to both read and modify information in App Store Connect, and, to make our lives easier and give us the best chance of success, we decided very early to piggyback on the amazing work that [Antoine van der Lee](https://x.com/twannl) had already done in the field and use his [appstoreconnect-swift-sdk](https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk).

The SDK provides us with a set of **autogenerated type-safe endpoints** and handles the process of **creating JSON Web Tokens** from a set of API credentials, which is not a simple process.

As we're good friends with [Antoine](https://x.com/twannl) and we're probably the biggest users of the SDK by now, **we decided to help maintain it**. And you might be wondering, why are you telling us all of this Pol? üòÖ

Well, I wanted to share how we use CI/CD in the SDK to work in our favor in a couple of ways:

1. ‚Äã[**Check for new ASC API versions automatically**:](https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk/blob/master/.github/workflows/sync_asc_api.yml) We found that we were constantly missing important updates to the App Store Connect API, so we decided to work on a scheduled workflow that checks for new releases of the API and creates a PR for us automatically.
2. ‚Äã[**Test on all available platforms**:](https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml) This is somewhat of a recent addition, but we made use of [Matt Massicotte](https://x.com/mattie)'s Swift Package template to add a workflow that runs the unit tests for all the platforms the SDK supports, including Linux. As a fun fact, when I implemented this workflow, I realised that the tests were failing on Linux and we had not noticed before üò±.

These are for me two great examples of how CI/CD can work in your favor and save you some time and I thought it would be interesting to share in this issue!

## ‚Äã[**üß™ Exploring built-in fastlane actions**](https://nowham.dev/posts/useful_built_ins?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_62)‚Äã

After years of active development, **fastlane** has truly become a **standard** in the community and helps many mobile apps of all shapes and sizes **automate their release processes**.

One of the things that makes **fastlane** so powerful is the amount of **built-in actions** and **lanes** that have been added over the years and are available out of the box. In this article, [Noam](https://x.com/No_Wham) walks you through some interesting ones you should know about.

## ‚Äã[**üá™üá∫ New requirements for apps in the EU are now enforced**](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6agg0lja)‚Äã

I have talked about the important new requirement that Apple has introduced for apps available in the European Union to comply with the [**EU's Digital Markets Act**](https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en) a fair amount in the past.

This requirement has now come into full effect, which means that any apps that have not yet declared their trader status have been **removed** from the store in the **European Union**. **Make sure you go and declare your trader status now if you haven't done so yet!**

## ‚Äã[**üñ•Ô∏è Bitrise makes M4 Pro runners available**](https://bitrise.io/blog/post/introducing-m4-pro-mac-mini-on-bitrise-more-power-speed-efficiency-for-your-ci-cd?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_62)‚Äã

If you're a [Bitrise](https://x.com/bitrise) user, here's some great news for you! Last week, [Arpad Kun](https://x.com/ArpadKun), their VP of Engineering and Infrastructure, announced that they are adding **M4 Pro Mac Mini** machines to their fleet of macOS runners.

If you want to benefit from the performance and speed improvements on your CI/CD workflows, make sure you read the announcement post and **sign up for early access**!

## ‚Äã[**üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è GitHub Copilot for Xcode is now generally available**](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-02-14-code-completion-in-github-copilot-for-xcode-is-now-generally-available?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_62)‚Äã

A while back, GitHub announced an **official Copilot extension for Xcode**. This was music to my ears, as I enjoyed using Copilot on VSCode and wished that they would make the extension available to Xcode too.

On the 14th of February, GitHub announced that the extension is now **generally available**. I have been using it since it came out and I have to say I love it, make sure you check it out! üòª

## ‚Äã[**üõ∏ Emerge tools CLI is available**](https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/the-emerge-cli?utm_source=ioscinewsletter&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=issue_62)‚Äã

As if the [Emerge Tools](https://x.com/emergetools) product was not good enough already, they have now added a CLI to their suite. This new tool allows you to interact with most of [Emerge Tools](https://x.com/emergetools)' services and it is designed for **a seamless CI/CD integration**.

Make sure you read the article and learn about how you can start using the CLI right away!
