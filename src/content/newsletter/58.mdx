**ü•Ç 2024 Wrapped ü•Ç**

I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre already reaching the end of the year! As 2024 comes to a close and I send out the final issue of the year, I want to take a moment to **reflect on what I‚Äôve been up to** and **highlight some of the things I‚Äôm most proud of**.

First of all, I‚Äôm thrilled to share that we‚Äôve grown **by over 1,000 subscribers** this year, bringing us to a total of **over 2,000 subscribers**!

When I first started the newsletter, I had two major worries: not being able to find **enough iOS CI content to fill an issue every two weeks** and not having **enough people interested in subscribing**.

Thanks to all of you, those worries are long gone. All I can say is‚Ä¶ thank you, to everyone who subscribed and to everyone who wrote amazing articles!

This is also the first time that the newsletter has been booked up by sponsors for the **whole year**, without missing a **single issue** and I want to take this opportunity to thank all sponsors for **their amazing support**!

On a professional level, this year has been full of changes. I made a big decision in July and decided to **quit my full-time job** and instead transition to **freelancing** and **working on my own indie apps**.

That decision led to the biggest highlight of my year: shipping [**Helm**](https://helm-app.com/), a native **macOS replacement for App Store Connect**, together with my good friend [Hidde](https://x.com/hiddevdploeg). Less than a year after launch, the reception has been incredible, and [Helm](http://helm-app.com/) remains my favorite project to work on!

As the year drew to a close, something even more exciting happened. Thanks to [Helm](http://helm-app.com/)_‚Äôs_ success and the fact that we all **shared a passion for improving developer experiences**, RevenueCat approached [Hidde](https://x.com/hiddevdploeg) and I to see if we were interested in collaborating.

And, after working on a small project for them in December and thoroughly enjoying it, I am super happy to share that [Hidde](https://x.com/hiddevdploeg) and I will officially join RevenueCat as part of a new **Developer Experience** team. [If you're interested in learning a bit more about what this means for Helm, make sure you check out the full blog post.](https://helm-app.com/changelog/helm-2024-past-present-future)

Last but certainly not least, whether you‚Äôve been here since the beginning or joined recently, I want to thank you for being part of this incredible journey and for helping the iOS CI Newsletter grow ‚ù§Ô∏è. I have so many exciting plans for 2024, so stay tuned!

There are probably a few things I‚Äôve forgotten to mention, but I think I‚Äôve talked about myself enough. So, without further ado, let‚Äôs kick off the final issue of 2024 by **revisiting the articles you enjoyed most this year!**

## [ü•á How a single Xcode setting can speed up your builds](https://pfandrade.me/blog/swift-build-times-and-module-verification?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2058%26utm_content%3D2024-12-29)

This brilliant article by [Paulo Andrade](https://x.com/pfandrade_) was the newsletter's most read article in 2024!

The articles goes through the process [Paulo Andrade](https://x.com/pfandrade_) followed to find the cause of **slow build time issues** using Xcode‚Äôs **build timing summaries** and how they discovered that **module verification** was responsible for the sluggish performance.

A must-read for anyone looking to optimize their app's build times.

## [ü•à Is SPM the right tool to manage your modular project?](https://medium.com/bumble-tech/scaling-ios-at-bumble-239e0fa009f2?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2058%26utm_content%3D2024-12-29)

These kind of articles where teams share their architectural decisions publically are my favourites to read and, by the looks of things, readers of the newsletter enjoy them too!

We tend to assume that the best way to manage local packages in a modular app is by using SPM. But is that really the case for your app? [Jonathan Crooke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathancrooke) shares in this article why SPM was not the right choice for [Bumble](https://twitter.com/Bumble_Tech).

## [ü•â How to significantly improve incremental build time with xcodebuild](https://github.com/wojciech-kulik/xcodebuild.nvim/issues/201#issuecomment-2423828065?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2058%26utm_content%3D2024-12-29)

Last but not least, in third place we have my personal favourite from the year. Did you know that incremental builds are **significantly slower in xcodebuild than in Xcode**?

I had no idea, but [Wojciech Kulik](https://x.com/kulik_wojciech) noticed it and found the exact reason why!
