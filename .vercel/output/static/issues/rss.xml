&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What a start to the year! 😱🤢&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you believe it has already been two weeks since I sent my last email and that we&apos;re &lt;strong&gt;halfway through January&lt;/strong&gt; already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time has certainly flown by on my end and, after an amazing Christmas break where I was able to take time off and get some rest, I went back to work and started getting back into my normal routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... just as was settling back in, a &lt;strong&gt;stomach bug caught me completely off-guard&lt;/strong&gt;, knocked me out for a few days and drained all the energy I had after my break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I am &lt;strong&gt;feeling a lot better now&lt;/strong&gt; and I am nearly back at full pace, just in time for this week&apos;s issue, which comes packed with updates and news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24&quot;&gt;‼️ New requirements for apps with third-party dependencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10060/&quot;&gt;In WWDC23, Apple introduced the concept of &lt;strong&gt;Privacy Manifests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are reports that help apps &lt;strong&gt;identify and define the privacy practices of their dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Spring this year, Apple will require apps that depend on any of the SDKs listed &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/&quot;&gt;in their announcement post&lt;/a&gt; to include their privacy manifests when submitting builds to App Store Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/visionos/submit?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24&quot;&gt;🎉 You can now submit visionOS apps to the App Store!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xcode 15.2&lt;/strong&gt; was released earlier this week and, for the first time, developers will be able to submit visionOS apps to App Store Connect with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Xcode Cloud has also been updated to include &lt;strong&gt;Xcode 15.2&lt;/strong&gt; and you can now update your workflows to build and upload visionOS apps. You must note though that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/release-notes/&quot;&gt;as stated in the latest Xcode Cloud release notes, test actions are not yet available for visionOS products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finnvoorhees.com/words/platform-specific-release-notes-with-xcode-cloud?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24&quot;&gt;📝 Platform-specific release notes with Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcode Cloud added support for setting &lt;strong&gt;release notes directly from a workflow during WWDC23&lt;/strong&gt;, rendering having to go and update the test notes in App Store Connect after submitting a new build needless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/finnvoorhees&quot;&gt;Finn Voorhees&lt;/a&gt; goes through how this feature works and how you can also provide different release notes for each platform your app supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://albertodebortoli.com/2024/01/03/scalable-continuous-integration-for-ios?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24&quot;&gt;🚀 Scalable iOS CI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love reading about &lt;strong&gt;real-world examples&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;stories&lt;/strong&gt; of CI/CD solutions used by companies of different sizes and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I came across this article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albertodebo&quot;&gt;Alberto de Bortoli&lt;/a&gt; on how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JET_technology&quot;&gt;Just Eat Takeaway.com&lt;/a&gt; leverages AWS, Packer, Terraform and GitHub Actions to manage a CI stack of macOS runners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2024-01-08-github-certifications-are-generally-available?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2033%26utm_content%3Djan_14_24&quot;&gt;🎓 GitHub Actions certifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GitHubEng&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; have recently announced that their Certification program, which was exclusively available to employees and partners up until now, is &lt;strong&gt;accessible to the general public&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&apos;t dived into it yet and there is more information on their announcement post but it certainly looks like a great way to learn more about GitHub Actions and get a certificate you can add to your CV at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;🎄🥂 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last issue of the year!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 🎄🥂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s the last day of 2023 already and I am writing the last issue of the year. Time certainly flies when you&apos;re having fun 😄.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been an incredible year for the newsletter and I want to thank you all for the amazing support you have shown since the very first issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the year, I wanted to pick my &lt;strong&gt;three favourite moments&lt;/strong&gt; and share them with you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🥇 &lt;strong&gt;Interacting with you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite thing from the start of the newsletter has been reading the replies I get after I send out every issue and improving based on the feedback I get from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I have met numerous new people thanks to the newsletter and I feel a lot more in touch with the community, which feels amazing 🤩.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🥈 1,000 subscribers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the year started, I was scared about people not being interested in the newsletter at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you have shown me that I was very wrong! Not only have I reached the 500 subscribers goal I set myself at the beginning of the year, but we are now over 1,000 subscribers! Thank you all so much 🙏.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🥉 The first-ever sponsor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very grateful to Runway for being such a wonderful sponsor and for helping me from the early days of the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having companies sponsor my work helps me keep delivering content for free and allowing free access to information, which is one of my key values as a content creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some awesome sponsors lined up for 2024 which I can&apos;t wait to share with you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the end of the year, I have put together a special issue where I look back at the year and pick the &lt;strong&gt;top 3&lt;/strong&gt; (or 4 as you will see in a second 😅) most-clicked articles of the year. They are amazing pieces of content that are &lt;strong&gt;worth revisiting in 2024&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🍾 That&apos;s it from me, Happy New Year everyone and see you all again next year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most read article of the year and rightly so! What a great write-up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manuherrera1&quot;&gt;Manu Herrera&lt;/a&gt; with so many tips to keep in the back of your mind when optimising your build times 🏎️.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;joint&lt;/em&gt; third place comes my personal favourite and the changes I am most looking forward to in 2024! This post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/throwspace&quot;&gt;Stuart Montgomery&lt;/a&gt; showcasing a new macro-based approach to testing that Apple has been working on is worth revisiting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least and in &lt;em&gt;joint&lt;/em&gt; third place is this amazing article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuan-hoang-b02025183/&quot;&gt;Tuan Hoang&lt;/a&gt; on how to automatically detect memory leaks on CI/CD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been bitten by memory leaks on both personal and work projects and they are sometimes hard to spot, so any automation you can get around them is always welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let&apos;s rest and plan for the new year!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday was my last day of work for the year as I decided to book next week and the few days between Christmas and New Year off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year has been great professionally but it has also been &lt;strong&gt;very stressful&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;overwhelming&lt;/strong&gt; at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between speaking at &lt;strong&gt;several conferences&lt;/strong&gt;, keeping up with &lt;strong&gt;weekly articles&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;fortnightly newsletter issues&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;full-time job&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;country move&lt;/strong&gt; and starting a &lt;strong&gt;new role&lt;/strong&gt;, I haven&apos;t had a single week off where I could fully disconnect from everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love what I do so I sometimes feel guilty expressing how stressed I sometimes get, but I was very relieved &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daveverwer&quot;&gt;Dave Verwer&lt;/a&gt; also spoke about this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/640#start&quot;&gt;latest issue of iOS Dev Weekly&lt;/a&gt;. It was a read I really needed as I could relate with everything Dave was saying and I was inspired to tell my own story too! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this, this year has been the hardest of my life personally and everything combined has made me take some &lt;strong&gt;much-needed rest&lt;/strong&gt; to recharge batteries for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said this, &lt;strong&gt;worry not&lt;/strong&gt; as there will still be articles over the next two weeks on my blog and a newsletter issue on the 31st, but I will finish getting them all ready tomorrow so I can relax for the whole Christmas break! 🎅🎄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ik9z4ll6&quot;&gt;☁️ 25 hours of Xcode Cloud now included with the Apple Developer Program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcode Cloud&apos;s free tier of &lt;strong&gt;25 compute hours per month&lt;/strong&gt;, which was scheduled to disappear in January 2024, will now be &lt;strong&gt;included&lt;/strong&gt; with the Apple Developer Program membership 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rogerluan_&quot;&gt;Roger Oba&lt;/a&gt; goes through how you can configure GitHub repositories &lt;strong&gt;using yaml config files&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a great way to &lt;strong&gt;sync settings across multiple repositories&lt;/strong&gt; and streamline the &lt;strong&gt;creation&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;configuration&lt;/strong&gt; of new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea you could do this and will be using it from now on 🤯.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/cocoapods-swift-macros?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2031%26utm_content%3Ddec_17_23&quot;&gt;📦 Distributing Swift macros using CocoaPods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently been digging into the &lt;strong&gt;build side of Swift macros&lt;/strong&gt; and how they can be distributed and imported without using Swift Package Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this week&apos;s article on my blog, I go through how you can leverage binaries to &lt;strong&gt;distribute&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;import&lt;/strong&gt; a Swift macro using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CocoaPods&quot;&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=uijoypq9&quot;&gt;🎅 Get your releases ready for Christmas!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the festive time of the year approaches again, I would like to remind you that, while &lt;strong&gt;Apple still accepts app submissions&lt;/strong&gt;, they say that reviews &lt;strong&gt;may take a bit longer&lt;/strong&gt; to complete from &lt;strong&gt;December 22nd to December 27th&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I would recommend you to plan accordingly if there is something big you&apos;d like to release before the end of the year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-14-github-actions-artifacts-v4-is-now-generally-available?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2031%26utm_content%3Ddec_17_23&quot;&gt;🚀 A new version of the artifacts action is out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub announced a couple of days ago that a new version (&lt;strong&gt;v4&lt;/strong&gt;) of the first-party &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact&quot;&gt;actions/upload-artifact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/download-artifact&quot;&gt;actions/download-artifact&lt;/a&gt; actions is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ While this release includes &lt;strong&gt;some performance improvements&lt;/strong&gt;, it also &lt;strong&gt;includes some breaking changes&lt;/strong&gt; so I would thoroughly encourage you &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/blob/main/README.md#v4---whats-new&quot;&gt;to read the full release notes&lt;/a&gt; before going through with the update!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;thirtieth issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I have reached a couple of very exciting milestones in my content creation career and I wanted to take the opportunity to reflect and look back at my journey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, after 30 issues of the newsletter, we are now over &lt;strong&gt;1,000 subscribers&lt;/strong&gt;, which I am super grateful to you all for! Also, with this week&apos;s article on my blog, I have now published over &lt;strong&gt;100 articles&lt;/strong&gt; and writing my weekly articles has been something that I have come to love and look forward to every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hasn&apos;t always been like that though. Three years ago I was &lt;strong&gt;very scared&lt;/strong&gt; of sharing any form of content online, let alone &lt;strong&gt;speaking in front of any kind of audience&lt;/strong&gt;! I always felt like I didn&apos;t have enough experience or expertise on what I was talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I decided to put these fears aside and share &lt;strong&gt;my first article&lt;/strong&gt;, then I did &lt;strong&gt;my first conference talk&lt;/strong&gt; and I finally &lt;strong&gt;sent the first issue&lt;/strong&gt; of this newsletter. And it&apos;s the best decision I have ever taken! If you&apos;re thinking of creating content online or doing some public speaking, I want to encourage you to do it! &lt;strong&gt;We all have something to share and learn from each other&lt;/strong&gt;, regardless of our experience level and background!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/binary-swift-macros?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2030%26utm_content%3Ddec_03_23&quot;&gt;🔨 How to import Swift macros without using Swift Package Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that you &lt;strong&gt;don&apos;t need a macro target&lt;/strong&gt; to write a Swift macro? And that you can import &lt;strong&gt;a macro as a binary&lt;/strong&gt; into an Xcode project without using SPM? And what if I told you you can even write and use a Swift macro &lt;strong&gt;without using SPM at all&lt;/strong&gt;? 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I show you how to create a Swift macro from an executable target and how you can import the resulting binary into an Xcode project without using Swift Package Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog-proxy.bitrise.io/post/self-hosted-vs-fully-managed-which-ci-cd-solution-is-right-for-your-organization?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2030%26utm_content%3Ddec_03_23&quot;&gt;🖥️ Self-hosted vs fully managed CI/CD solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing which solution to go with for your app&apos;s CI/CD is important. On the one hand, you can opt for going for &lt;strong&gt;hosting your runners&lt;/strong&gt; which gives you more control but a lot more maintenance overhead and, on the other hand, you can opt for a &lt;strong&gt;fully managed solution&lt;/strong&gt; that takes care of the maintenance for you to let you focus on building your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt; blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ClaireSpeedy1&quot;&gt;Claire Speedy&lt;/a&gt; goes through both approaches and helps you pick the one that&apos;s best for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bazelbuild&quot;&gt;Bazel&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;strong&gt;open-source tool&lt;/strong&gt; that helps developers automate the build and test process of their applications. While I have not used it myself, I know it is &lt;strong&gt;used by big companies such as Spotify to build their iOS apps&lt;/strong&gt; and looks very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/nevercodehq/&quot;&gt;Codemagic&lt;/a&gt; blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/babelly20&quot;&gt;Mohammed Babelly&lt;/a&gt; gives you an awesome introduction to how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bazelbuild&quot;&gt;Bazel&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on getting it set up and running on a CI/CD workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/swift-sdks?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2030%26utm_content%3Ddec_03_23&quot;&gt;📦 Use Swift SDKs to cross-compile Swift packages to Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Apple app developer, you will be familiar with &lt;strong&gt;cross-compiling code for different platforms&lt;/strong&gt; such as iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS with very minimal setup and directly from Xcode. However, if you try to cross-compile Swift code for any other platform such as Linux, you will soon find out how arduous the process is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Apple has made this process much easier with the introduction of &lt;strong&gt;Swift SDKs&lt;/strong&gt;, as I explain in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://attendees.bizzabo.com/485407/agenda/activity/1203970?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2030%26utm_content%3Ddec_03_23&quot;&gt;📹 Using EC2 Mac for your iOS CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recordings for &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s Mobile DevOps Summit 2023 are now up and available for everyone to watch. Among this year&apos;s sessions, there is one that particularly stood out to me: &lt;strong&gt;Apple @ AWS—CI/CD developer environments on EC2 Mac&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/siederer/&quot;&gt;Dave Siederer&lt;/a&gt;, a Specialist Solutions Architect at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awscloud&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;, goes through how and why to use &lt;strong&gt;EC2 Mac instances to build your Apple apps on CI/CD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might know, this month is the last chance you have to try out Xcode Cloud for free before the free plan goes away in 2024 and the lowest usage tier &lt;strong&gt;costs $14.99 a month&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;d like to try it before then and don&apos;t know where to start, I would thoroughly recommend watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wescsk&quot;&gt;Wes Chua&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s free course on Youtube!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-ninth issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These past couple of weeks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hiddevdploeg&quot;&gt;Hidde&lt;/a&gt; and I have been busy working on a very &lt;strong&gt;exciting update for &lt;a href=&quot;https://nowplaying.page&quot;&gt;NowPlaying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which we will ship next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main focus has been on &lt;strong&gt;performance&lt;/strong&gt; and working on some &lt;strong&gt;Core Data improvements&lt;/strong&gt; such as migrating the models, improving the queries, and making our &lt;strong&gt;persistent containers work for iOS widgets by moving the store to the device&apos;s App Group container&lt;/strong&gt;. I have written about the latter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/core-data-migration-app-group&quot;&gt;on my blog this week&lt;/a&gt; if you&apos;re interested in doing something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is challenging and stressful at times, indie projects are &lt;strong&gt;incredibly rewarding&lt;/strong&gt;. Not only are you working on your own product, but you also get the chance to work on features and learn about topics of iOS development that you usually wouldn&apos;t in a big company. I would thoroughly encourage everyone to start their own side projects and collaborate with other members of the community, &lt;strong&gt;it is a great way to learn and grow as an engineer&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/swift-testing&quot;&gt;🔮 A (very) early look at the future of testing in Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/throwspace&quot;&gt;Stuart Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, a software engineer working in the XCTest team at Apple, introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-testing&quot;&gt;new macro-based open-source proof of concept Swift package&lt;/a&gt; for what the future of testing could look like in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to try the library out a couple of weeks ago and share my findings in this article on my blog. Long story short, I am a &lt;strong&gt;very big fan of it&lt;/strong&gt; and I &lt;strong&gt;believe it improves the syntax of unit tests significantly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tuistio/status/1725544460053012833&quot;&gt;💬 In-line errors on PRs with Tuist and GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the work that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pepicrft&quot;&gt;Pedro&lt;/a&gt; and the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tuistio&quot;&gt;Tuist&lt;/a&gt; have been putting into the library recently, it is rapidly &lt;strong&gt;becoming a standard for architecting and building iOS applications&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time they have announced that an upcoming release of the library is going to &lt;strong&gt;add support for showing errors on GitHub PRs as in-line comments using GitHub Actions&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.runway.team/blog/introducing-rollbacks-by-runway&quot;&gt;🔙 Deploy iOS apps safely with instant rollbacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RunwayTeam&quot;&gt;Runway&lt;/a&gt; announced that they are introducing a brand new feature: &lt;strong&gt;rollbacks for native mobile apps&lt;/strong&gt;. This new feature will allow developers &lt;strong&gt;to ship apps in a much safer way&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;quickly roll back versions&lt;/strong&gt; if things go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article goes into detail about &lt;strong&gt;how this new feature&lt;/strong&gt; works and why you would want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/11/the-what-why-and-how-of-mastering-app-size&quot;&gt;📏 Keeping an eye on your app size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/petrovski_vic&quot;&gt;Viktor Petrovski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/povolotskydmitry&quot;&gt;Dmitry Povolotskyi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rockbruno_&quot;&gt;Bruno Rocha&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SpotifyEng&quot;&gt;Spotify Engineering&lt;/a&gt; blog goes through why app size is a very important metric that we mobile app developers should closely monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also show tools and processes Spotify uses to ensure no major increases in app size occur at different points in their development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77267883/how-do-i-trust-a-swift-macro-target-for-xcode-cloud-builds&quot;&gt;🔐 Enabling macros on CI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be using &lt;strong&gt;third-party macros&lt;/strong&gt; and you&apos;re &lt;strong&gt;struggling to enable them to get your project to compile on CI&lt;/strong&gt;, this Stack Overflow answer shows you how you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;code&gt;xcodebuild&lt;/code&gt; flag you can pass called &lt;code&gt;-skipMacroValidation&lt;/code&gt; and, even if you can&apos;t modify the xcodebuild command itself, there is a &lt;code&gt;defaults&lt;/code&gt; setting you can use on your runner to enable all macros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-eigth issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am especially excited about this issue as it features a mixture of content from the community ranging from &lt;strong&gt;amazing updates to open-source projects&lt;/strong&gt; to running Swift projects on &lt;strong&gt;non-Apple platforms&lt;/strong&gt; like Windows or AWS amazonlinux runners!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how far Swift is going as a language and how much you can do with it these days! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/running-swift-on-widnows-with-gha&quot;&gt;🚀 Making your Swift tools available on Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a &lt;strong&gt;Swift command-line tool&lt;/strong&gt; and want to make it available for &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; users? Well, you&apos;ll be happy to know that you don&apos;t have to rewrite your program in a different language or &lt;strong&gt;even own a Windows machine&lt;/strong&gt; to do so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I show you in this article, all you need is a CI/CD pipeline capable of spinning up a Windows runner and installing a Swift toolchain on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/194#discussioncomment-7406759&quot;&gt;🎉 Fastlane officially moves to the Mobile Native Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had an amazing update from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulbeusterien&quot;&gt;Paul Beusterien&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of moving &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools&quot;&gt;Fastlane&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s ownership from Google, who weren&apos;t actively maintaining it, over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mobilenativefdn&quot;&gt;Mobile Native Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This move is going to help &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools&quot;&gt;Fastlane&lt;/a&gt; massively and I want to give a massive shout-out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshdholtz&quot;&gt;Josh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/paulbeusterien&quot;&gt;Paul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SmileyKeith&quot;&gt;Keith&lt;/a&gt; and everyone else involved for their work to make this happen ❤️.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://albertodebortoli.com/2023/10/29/the-idea-of-a-fastlane-replacement/&quot;&gt;⭐️ Stellar: The idea of Swift replacement for Fastlane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/FastlaneTools&quot;&gt;Fastlane&lt;/a&gt; and I use it extensively on &lt;strong&gt;my day-to-day&lt;/strong&gt; both on work and personal projects, I am not the biggest fan of &lt;strong&gt;ruby&lt;/strong&gt; (the language Fastlane is built on top of) and I prefer to use &lt;strong&gt;Swift for tools&lt;/strong&gt; as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albertodebo&quot;&gt;Alberto de Bortoli&lt;/a&gt; told me about this idea he and some colleagues at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JET_technology&quot;&gt;Just Eat&lt;/a&gt; were exploring to build an alternative to Fastlane built exclusively in Swift, I thought it was very interesting. While they are not focusing on making the project ready for production at the moment, they have &lt;strong&gt;open-sourced the code&lt;/strong&gt; for everyone to contribute and take a look 👀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tuist.io/blog/2023/11/03/glovo/&quot;&gt;🚴 Behind the scenes of the Glovo iOS app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might know from the last issue of the newsletter, I started working for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/glovo&quot;&gt;a Spanish company called Glovo&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago and I was over the moon when I saw this interview with my colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/cvdavid/?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;David Cacenabes&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tuistio&quot;&gt;Tuist&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/cvdavid/?locale=en_US&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; goes through how &lt;strong&gt;modularity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;efficient processes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tooling&lt;/strong&gt; are helping &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/glovo&quot;&gt;Glovo&lt;/a&gt; achieve their goals and ensure a great user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this year&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/swift_leeds&quot;&gt;SwiftLeeds conference&lt;/a&gt; and after a long time of following each other online, I finally met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andreascuderi13&quot;&gt;Andrea Scuderi&lt;/a&gt; in person for the first time and we had a great chat about &lt;strong&gt;Swift&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AWS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;serverless computing&lt;/strong&gt;. I have been a fan of his project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swift-sprinter/Breeze&quot;&gt;Breeze&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time and it indeed makes &lt;strong&gt;developing Swift AWS serverless APIs a lot simpler&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NSLondonMeetup&quot;&gt;NSLondon&lt;/a&gt;, he goes through how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swift-sprinter/Breeze&quot;&gt;Breeze&lt;/a&gt; to create serverless APIs using Swift and AWS 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-seventh issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first issue I am &lt;strong&gt;sending from Spain&lt;/strong&gt;, which is my new home as of last week. My partner and I made the decision to relocate to Spain after nine wonderful years in the UK, which meant that I had to &lt;strong&gt;leave my role at the BBC&lt;/strong&gt; where I have learnt a lot and grown as an engineer and move on to a new adventure as an &lt;strong&gt;iOS developer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://glovoapp.com?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23&quot;&gt;Glovo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the new job a few days ago and I will be working from their Barcelona offices, which I am super excited about. Alongside my day-to-day product work, I am also looking forward to making a positive impact and bringing my expertise to the table in the &lt;strong&gt;CI/CD domain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are based in Barcelona, give me a shout and we&apos;ll meet up for a coffee ☕️. Now, let&apos;s get into it and see what&apos;s new in the iOS CI world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/info-plist-swift-cli?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23&quot;&gt;💡 Adding an Info.plist file to a Swift executable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently discovered that you can &lt;strong&gt;add information such as a bundle identifier&lt;/strong&gt; to a Swift command-line tool using an &lt;code&gt;Info.plist&lt;/code&gt; file. The best thing is that you can do so by adding a section to the executable so that you can still ship it &lt;strong&gt;as a single file&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is fairly simple and works for both &lt;strong&gt;Swift Package&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Xcode project&lt;/strong&gt; executable targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/1714907618706170230?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23&quot;&gt;⚠️ Xcode 15.0.1 still suffers from test performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I came across this tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dimillian&quot;&gt;Thomas Ricouard&lt;/a&gt; where he shared that, despite Apple&apos;s 15.0.1 bug fix release to address the slow first runs of test suites, &lt;strong&gt;the issue was still apparent&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the replies, it seems that some users are &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NachoSoto/status/1715031262589780323&quot;&gt;no longer experiencing freezes and hangs but rather the tests now seem to run 2x slower than they used to do on Xcode 14&lt;/a&gt; 😱.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://levelup.gitconnected.com/automating-memory-leak-detection-with-ci-integration-for-ios-380f08a55f0b?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23&quot;&gt;🪠 Automated memory leak detection on CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed reading this article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuan-hoang-b02025183&quot;&gt;Tuan Hoang&lt;/a&gt; where he explains the &lt;strong&gt;difference between memory leaks and retain cycles&lt;/strong&gt; and how tricky it is sometimes to identify leaks, even when using the memory debugger in Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about this article is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/tuan-hoang-b02025183&quot;&gt;Tuan Hoang&lt;/a&gt; went ahead and came up with an &lt;strong&gt;automation process&lt;/strong&gt; that uses UI tests, Apple&apos;s leaks tool and a custom script that parses memgraphs to detect memory leaks 🤯.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.1password.com/1password-service-accounts?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23&quot;&gt;🔐 1Password + CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this post is from earlier in the year, I only discovered that you can retrieve secrets from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/1Password&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; directly from your CI/CD workflows last week. I have been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/1Password&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; user for a long time and I can&apos;t wait to try this out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-j-carey/&quot;&gt;Michael Carey&lt;/a&gt; shows an example of how to use the feature in GitHub Actions, but there are many providers supported. If you&apos;d like to see an example using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codemagicio&quot;&gt;Codemagic&lt;/a&gt;, check out this great article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/himesh_p&quot;&gt;Himesh Panchal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/865678854?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2027%26utm_content%3Doct_22_23&quot;&gt;📹 [NSSpain] Why CI/CD won&apos;t save your mobile team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed watching the video for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GabrielSavit&quot;&gt;Gabriel Savit&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NSSpain&quot;&gt;NSSpain&lt;/a&gt;, where he goes through &lt;strong&gt;numerous aviation-themed automation examples&lt;/strong&gt; and how &lt;strong&gt;they apply to mobile teams&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While CI/CD is a key factor to ensuring your team&apos;s success, &lt;strong&gt;it won&apos;t be enough on its own&lt;/strong&gt;. There are several &lt;strong&gt;other processes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;automations&lt;/strong&gt; that need to be considered as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GabrielSavit&quot;&gt;Gabriel&lt;/a&gt; explains in his talk 👍.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-sixth issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time this issue of the newsletter is sent, I will already be in Leeds in preparation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/swift_leeds&quot;&gt;SwiftLeeds&lt;/a&gt;, which I am super excited about. This conference has a special meaning for me as it will be the &lt;strong&gt;last conference that I speak at or attend&lt;/strong&gt; while I am living in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1707845642045829565&quot;&gt;As I announced this week&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;strong&gt;2 wonderful years at the BBC&lt;/strong&gt; where I have met and learnt from some amazing people and &lt;strong&gt;9 years living in the UK&lt;/strong&gt; where I have met most of my best friends and first lived together with my fiancé, it is now time for a new chapter &lt;strong&gt;back home in Spain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, I am now frantically packing and getting ready for the move but I am still &lt;strong&gt;committed to delivering some good content for everyone&lt;/strong&gt;, so keep your eyes peeled for articles coming in the next few weeks! Also, if you happen to be in Leeds and you attend the conference, make sure you come up to me and say hi! 👋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2023-10-02-github-actions-apple-silicon-m1-macos-runners-are-now-available-in-public-beta?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2026%26utm_content%3Doct_08_23&quot;&gt;🎉 M1 GitHub-hosted runners publicly available!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub announced this week on their blog that &lt;strong&gt;M1 macOS runners are now available&lt;/strong&gt; to any developer, team or enterprise using GitHub Actions on a &lt;strong&gt;public beta&lt;/strong&gt;! This change has been a long time coming and I am excited it has finally landed 😍.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ These so-called &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; runners are &lt;strong&gt;excluded&lt;/strong&gt; from GitHub Action&apos;s free tier and, even if you are using them on a public repository, &lt;strong&gt;you will charged for using them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-15_1-release-notes#Resolved-Issues?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2026%26utm_content%3Doct_08_23&quot;&gt;🆙 Xcode 15.1 fixes a big performance issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcode 15&apos;s stable version shipped with a bug &lt;strong&gt;that caused the first run of a test suite to take a significant amount of time to launch on an iOS simulator&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue was noticed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog-proxy.bitrise.io/post/xcode-15-performance-regressions?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2026%26utm_content%3Doct_08_23&quot;&gt;mitigated by CI/CD providers like Bitrise&lt;/a&gt;, but the true fix to the issue has now landed with the release of Xcode 15.1. If you migrated to using &lt;strong&gt;Xcode 15 on CI/CD&lt;/strong&gt;, make sure you update now to benefit from this fix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://arturgruchala.com/lost-art-of-makefile?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2026%26utm_content%3Doct_08_23&quot;&gt;📦 Makefiles for iOS developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I tend to default to plugins and Swift scripts at the moment, I have thoroughly enjoyed using Makefiles in the past to improve &lt;strong&gt;developer experience&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;streamline tasks&lt;/strong&gt; like bootstrapping a project or building a binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GruchalaArtur&quot;&gt;Artur Gruchała&lt;/a&gt; explains how Makefiles work and shares a couple of use cases where you might want to use them as an iOS developer 👏.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a big fan of third-party analytics frameworks in general and I have always preferred &lt;strong&gt;rolling my solution&lt;/strong&gt; with data that stays on &lt;strong&gt;my servers&lt;/strong&gt; where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do understand that, due to time constraints and cost of implementation, this &lt;strong&gt;might not be possible&lt;/strong&gt; and you might need to go for a &lt;strong&gt;third-party solution&lt;/strong&gt;. If you do so, I would recommend checking out this article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bcapps&quot;&gt;Brian Capps&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt; blog where they analyze &lt;strong&gt;the impact of popular analytics frameworks on an application&lt;/strong&gt;. Brilliant stuff as always on their blog! 👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I have only used SwiftLint in the past, I have heard wonderful things about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat&quot;&gt;SwiftFormat&lt;/a&gt; and how it can work very well alongside SwiftLint. For a while now I have been looking for a comprehensive guide about it and I am so happy I have finally found it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranavkasetti/&quot;&gt;Pranav Kasetti&lt;/a&gt; goes through every possible way you can set up &lt;strong&gt;SwiftFormat automation for your project&lt;/strong&gt;. From build phases and SPM plugins, all the way through to git hooks and Danger checks on CI/CD! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the twenty-fifth issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a couple of weeks these have been if you&apos;re a Swift developer! We got a &lt;strong&gt;new version of iOS and Swift&lt;/strong&gt;, a new &lt;strong&gt;release of Xcode&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;brand-new devices too&lt;/strong&gt;. I bought myself an iOS 15 Pro and an Apple Watch Ultra 2, which were delivered on Friday and I am loving them so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of what I have been working on, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hiddevdploeg&quot;&gt;Hidde&lt;/a&gt; and I have been busy getting a vastly improved and redesigned version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://nowplaying.page&quot;&gt;NowPlaying&lt;/a&gt; ready for release. We&apos;re hoping to have it out at some point in October with some great new features such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hiddevdploeg/status/1703358795710189900&quot;&gt;interactive widgets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1696970984165724208&quot;&gt;better airdrop support&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; App Clips to better share songs with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📬 I&apos;ll keep you all up to date on how the new version is coming along, but in the meantime, let&apos;s get into this week&apos;s newsletter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/setting-up-swift-on-linux-ci-cd-using-swiftly?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;🚀 How to set up Swift on Linux using swiftly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swift.org/sswg?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;Swift Server Workgroup (SSWG)&lt;/a&gt; released version 0.1.0 of their open-source tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swift-server/swiftly&quot;&gt;swiftly&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easy for developers to &lt;strong&gt;download, install and manage Swift toolchains&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate this release, I wrote an article on how to set up Swift on a Linux CI/CD machine on GitHub Actions using swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mattmassicotte/PackageTemplate?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;📦 Swift Package template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I &lt;a href=&quot;https://iosdev.space/@mattiem@mastodon.social/111092498537696610&quot;&gt;tooted about my article on how to set up Swift on Linux&lt;/a&gt; last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iosdev.space/@mattiem@mastodon.social&quot;&gt;Matt Massicotte&lt;/a&gt; replied with a link to his Swift Package template, which I hadn&apos;t come across before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The template, which is open-source and available on GitHub, is a great starting point for making new Swift packages. It includes several useful features, such as a setting to enable complete concurrency checking, a YAML file with configuration for adding the new package to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftpackageindex.com?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;Swift Package Index&lt;/a&gt;, and a GitHub Actions workflow for running tests on CI/CD for both Apple and Linux platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.9-released?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;🎉 Swift 5.9 is out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with the release of iOS 17, Apple announced last week that Swift 5.9 is now out too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some great improvements to the language, Swift 5.9 also includes some new game-changing features for tooling and CI/CD, such as the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/xcode-15-automated-accessibility-audits?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;accessibility audits in Xcode 15&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/network-requests-in-swift-package-plugins?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;new network request permissions for Swift Package plugins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;⚠️ Time to update your GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node 16 has now reached its end of life and, as a consequence, GitHub has started its deprecation process for GitHub actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re using GitHub Actions that use Node under the hood, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/checkout&quot;&gt;actions/checkout&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact&quot;&gt;actions/upload-artifact&lt;/a&gt;, you&apos;ll start seeing warnings in your logs. To silence them, you&apos;ll need to update to the latest version of these actions (v4), which are now available and use Node 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a bunch of workflows you need to update, I would recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.eidinger.info/why-and-how-to-adopt-actionscheckoutv3-in-your-github-action-workflow#heading-how?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger&quot;&gt;Marco Eidinger&lt;/a&gt; as it includes a handy script to automate the process that you can &lt;strong&gt;update to use version 4 instead of 3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitrise.io/blog/post/summit-speaker-spotlight-series-aws?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;🖥️ How to use EC2 Macs for Apple app CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://summit.bitrise.io?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;Mobile DevOps Summit&lt;/a&gt; is coming up in a couple of weeks and, to celebrate the occasion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt; is publishing a series of spotlight articles on some of the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A session that caught my eye and I am looking forward to is &lt;strong&gt;Apple @ AWS—CI/CD developer environments on EC2 Mac&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/siederer&quot;&gt;Dave Siederer&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Senior Specialist Solutions Architect for EC2 Mac at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/awscloud&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There has been a recent trend of companies moving their &lt;strong&gt;CI/CD systems to EC2 Macs&lt;/strong&gt;, and I&apos;m looking forward to hearing more about the benefits and experiences of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.swift.org/t/a-new-approach-to-testing-in-swift/67425?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2025%26utm_content%3Dsept_24_23&quot;&gt;🧪 A new macro-based approach to testing in Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swift Forums are a great place to keep up to date with the latest developments in the Swift community. This week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/throwspace&quot;&gt;Stuart Montgomery&lt;/a&gt;, a software engineer working on the XCTest team at Apple, shared a new macro-based open-source Swift testing library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&apos;t tried it yet, but the code snippets in the post look very interesting and I&apos;m looking forward to giving it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-fourth issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just back home after spending the week at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IOSDEVUK&quot;&gt;iOS Dev UK&lt;/a&gt; in Aberystwyth 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿, where I gave a talk about &lt;strong&gt;making developer tools with Swift&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I went through a few examples of &lt;strong&gt;automations&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt; that I have built in the past and why it is a good idea to build any &lt;strong&gt;developer tools which are internal to your iOS or macOS team in Swift&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy with how the talk went, how much positive feedback I got and how many people came up to me to share either their own experiences with building developer tools with Swift, to ask for advice on problems they were facing or to say that they were going to start building more tooling with Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re interested in taking a look at the slides, where I also share numerous resources that might be useful to you, you can find them &lt;a href=&quot;https://pol.link/iosdevuk23&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/xcode-15-automated-accessibility-audits&quot;&gt;🚀 Automated accessibility testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I wrote an article on how you can perform automated accessibility audits in Xcode 15, which shows you how you can use new &lt;code&gt;XCUIElement&lt;/code&gt; APIs to ensure your app is accessible directly in your UI tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the article I also have a section showing you how you can run these tests on CI with a single command and how you can access the result bundle for the audit and make it available to your team when the job fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftrocks.com/faster-performance-debugging-with-ettrace&quot;&gt;⚡️ ETTrace: Faster performance debugging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back I announced that the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt; had released a framework aimed at making performance debugging easier and faster than Xcode&apos;s instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rockbruno_&quot;&gt;Bruno Rocha&lt;/a&gt;, who I have been following for a while and whose articles I always enjoy, wrote a great article on how ETTrace works and how it can help you debug performance issues in your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roger.ml/p/launching-statused&quot;&gt;✅ Get ASC app status updates on Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rogerluan_&quot;&gt;Roger Oba&lt;/a&gt;, one of fastlane&apos;s core contributors, has launched a brand new service called &lt;a href=&quot;https://statused.com&quot;&gt;Statused&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to get updates on your App Store Connect app&apos;s status directly in Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a brilliant idea and it&apos;s a great way for you and your team to get notified about any issues with your app&apos;s status, such as when it&apos;s processing or when it&apos;s ready for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manu.show/2023-09-03-self-hosted-gha-runners/&quot;&gt;💻 How to set up self-hosted GHA runners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manuherrera1&quot;&gt;Manu Herrera&lt;/a&gt; has been sharing amazing content around tooling and automation on his blog recently and it&apos;s very quickly becoming one of my favourite CI/CD online resources to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manuherrera1&quot;&gt;Manu&lt;/a&gt; wrote a great article on how to set up self-hosted GitHub Actions runners, which is a great way to speed up your CI/CD workflows and reduce your costs. Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manuherrera1&quot;&gt;Manu&lt;/a&gt; compares self-hosted runners to GitHub-hosted ones and weighs up the pros and cons of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/edreams-odigeo-tech/tuist-your-circle-putting-it-to-the-test-part-1-8dc168aefe7a&quot;&gt;🧪 Automated testing of Tuist projects on CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ronanoc&quot;&gt;Ronan&lt;/a&gt; at NSBarcelona a few months ago and we had a great chat about Tuist, CI/CD and automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, he mentioned that he was working on a series of articles on how to set up automated testing for Tuist projects on CI/CD and this week he published the first part of the series, which is worth a read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-third issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very excited to announce that I have recently launched a brand new macOS app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getqreate.app&quot;&gt;QReate&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to generate fully customisable QR codes to help you showcase your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it couldn&apos;t be any other way the deployment process is fully automated using Xcode Cloud, which has helped me save a lot of time and effort when releasing new versions of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have shared extensive content about my experience using Xcode Cloud (TLDR; I am a big fan ❤️) so if you&apos;re interested in learning more about it, check out these free resources I have created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt; have recently launched another great framework called &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.emergetools.com/docs/reaper&quot;&gt;Reaper&lt;/a&gt; that helps you identify dead code in your application and remove it. What&apos;s cool about this new framework is that it doesn&apos;t just do a static analysis of your code but instead detects unused code at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out more about how it works and how you can try the beta version out, check out this article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sond813&quot;&gt;Noah Martin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use the GitHub Actions default macOS runners for your CI/CD, you will notice that they can be quite slow and expensive to run. For this reason, many teams have started migrating to self-hosted runners to save money and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Whatnot&quot;&gt;Whatnot&lt;/a&gt; did and one of their engineers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/sliwaadrian&quot;&gt;Adrian Śliwa&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a great article about the process and how migrating to self-hosted EC2 macOS instances helped them save around $5,000 per month! 🤯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I came across this thread on Twitter where &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rogerluan_&quot;&gt;Roger Oba&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools&quot;&gt;Fastlane&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; contributors, explained why &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools&quot;&gt;Fastlane&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; CircleCI workflows suddenly stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt a lot about the &lt;code&gt;nm&lt;/code&gt; command from this article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mfaani&quot;&gt;Mohammad Faani&lt;/a&gt; and how to use it to inspect the size impact of symbols in an app&apos;s binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-second&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, I have been asked by numerous people whether my &lt;strong&gt;most-read articles tweets&lt;/strong&gt;, which round up the three posts with the most unique visitors on my blog, are automated or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that they used to be but they no longer are and today I&apos;ll tell you &lt;strong&gt;why that is the case and what&lt;/strong&gt; I am doing to automate them again 😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially implemented the automation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/scheduling-tweets-with-github-actions-and-swift?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2022%26utm_content%3Daug_13_2&quot;&gt;as a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow that would run every Friday at noon and invoke a Swift CLI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, the Swift CLI would then make a &lt;strong&gt;network request to my blog&apos;s analytics provider to get the week&apos;s most read articles&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;format the response&lt;/strong&gt; into a tweetable string and communicate with Twitter&apos;s API to &lt;strong&gt;post the results to my profile&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this approach was simple, it stopped working pretty soon. Due to inactivity in the repository (it only existed to run the workflow), &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions decided to turn all workflows off after 60 days&lt;/strong&gt;, breaking my automation 😭.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it&apos;s going&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have fixed the issue by having the workflow commit some code back to the repository but that didn&apos;t feel like the right solution and I wanted &lt;strong&gt;something scalable that worked long-term&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some research, I decided to start migrating the CLI code into a &lt;strong&gt;Swift AWS lambda&lt;/strong&gt; which would run on a schedule, much like the GitHub Actions workflow did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not yet finished the implementation but I have written &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/scheduled-swift-aws-lambdas?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2022%26utm_content%3Daug_13_2&quot;&gt;an initial article on how you can set up scheduled Swift AWS lambdas&lt;/a&gt; and, over the next few weeks, I will be sharing how I get on with the rest of the migration! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/klaaspieter/chxcode&quot;&gt;🔁 Chxcode: a tool to easily manage Xcode versions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://iosdev.space/@christianselig@mastodon.social/110821564177415531&quot;&gt;and thanks to a Mastodon thread 🐘&lt;/a&gt;, I came across an awesome tool built by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/klaaspieter&quot;&gt;Klaas Pieter Annema&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to switch between multiple versions of Xcode directly from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool is coming in particularly handy for me this time of year as I have &lt;strong&gt;multiple stable and beta releases of Xcode&lt;/strong&gt; installed on my machine and I constantly find myself switching between them 👏.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 If you&apos;re interested in other cool solutions to the same problem, there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianselig.com/2023/08/smartly-open-xcode?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2022%26utm_content%3Daug_13_2&quot;&gt;an amazing article on using keyboard shortcuts to smartly open the correct version of Xcode&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig&quot;&gt;Christian Selig&lt;/a&gt; and a ruby script you can use directly from your Fastfile by &lt;a href=&quot;https://iosdev.space/@WLBORg@hachyderm.io&quot;&gt;Wolfgang Lutz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.eidinger.info/github-embraces-swift-and-provides-code-analysis-security-alerts-and-dependency-updates-for-swift-projects?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2022%26utm_content%3Daug_13_2&quot;&gt;🎉 GitHub&apos;s CodeQL and Dependabot now support Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GitHubEng&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that both &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeql.github.com/&quot;&gt;CodeQL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dependabot&quot;&gt;Dependabot&lt;/a&gt; have now &lt;strong&gt;added support for Swift&lt;/strong&gt;. You can now use these tools to &lt;strong&gt;get security alerts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;detect vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;automatically update out-of-date dependencies&lt;/strong&gt; on Swift projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would thoroughly recommend reading this article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger&quot;&gt;Marco Eidinger&lt;/a&gt; as he goes through everything you need to know about these tools and how you start using them now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mdb1.github.io/2023-08-12-use-fastlane-to-create-prs?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2022%26utm_content%3Daug_13_2&quot;&gt;🔨 Create Pull Requests automatically using Fastlane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading this article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manuherrera1&quot;&gt;Manuel Herrera&lt;/a&gt; on how to write a Fastlane lane to create Pull Requests directly from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lane has a lot of functionality built in and makes creating &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;great-looking&lt;/strong&gt; Pull Requests a breeze!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tanaschita.com/20230724-fastlane-screenshots-ios?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2022%26utm_content%3Daug_13_2&quot;&gt;📸 Automatic screenshot generation with Fastlane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While often overlooked, I personally believe that &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/snapshot/&quot;&gt;the snapshot action&lt;/a&gt; is one of Fastlane&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;most powerful&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;time-saving&lt;/strong&gt; features for developers as it can automatically take screenshots of your mobile application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanaschita&quot;&gt;Natascha Fadeeva&lt;/a&gt; goes through how snapshot works and what some of its use cases are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really enjoying all of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albertodebo&quot;&gt;Alberto de Bortoli&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s AWS-themed articles recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albertodebo&quot;&gt;Alberto&lt;/a&gt; provides a great explanation of the not-trivial and documentation-lacking process of setting up &lt;strong&gt;CloudWatch on Mac EC2 instances&lt;/strong&gt; 👏.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twenty-first&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time this issue goes out, I will officially be on holiday in Spain visiting family. I will be here for about a week recharging my batteries and getting ready for a busy second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three very exciting talks coming up in the UK in September, October and December that I am looking forward to and a bunch of new projects I can&apos;t wait to share with you 😬.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re going to be around the UK and want to catch up, you can see the list of events I will be speaking at on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/speaking?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_31_23&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed reading this article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mood_tuna&quot;&gt;Geor Kasapidi&lt;/a&gt; on how to commit Swift Package Manager dependencies to source control. This is a problem we tried to solve at the BBC when we started using SPM alongside CocoaPods and, similarly to what we already did with pods, we wanted to ensure reproducible builds and mitigate any security risks on CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/safely-pinning-spm-depedencies-to-exact-versions?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_31_23&quot;&gt;an article on the solution we came up with at the time&lt;/a&gt; but we will revisit our approach with what &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mood_tuna&quot;&gt;Geor&lt;/a&gt; has shared! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt; have recently urged all users not on private or dedicated plans to start testing their builds for Xcode 15 on the Edge stacks to ensure no disruption occurs in September when Xcode 15 is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt; user, make sure you check out this article and start testing your builds on the Edge stacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish this article by the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger&quot;&gt;Marco Eidinger&lt;/a&gt; had been around when I first tried to precompile a Swift Package into a binary, it would have saved me a lot of time and headaches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precompiling Swift Packages into binaries is a great way to speed up your CI builds as you can avoid having to build the package from source every time but it can truly be a pain to set up. This article guides you through everything you need to know and points you to some very useful resources and open-source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/testableapple&quot;&gt;Alexey Alter-Pesotskiy&lt;/a&gt; shares how you can remove secrets from your code by using &lt;code&gt;.xcconfig&lt;/code&gt; files, CI secrets and environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also use &lt;code&gt;.xcconfig&lt;/code&gt; files to remove secrets from code and repositories both for personal and work projects but you must know this approach is not completely secure. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattt&quot;&gt;Matt (NSHipster)&lt;/a&gt; explains in &lt;a href=&quot;https://nshipster.com/secrets?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_31_23&quot;&gt;this amazing article about secrets&lt;/a&gt;, the only way to truly keep secrets safe is to not have them in the client in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/r_alikhamov&quot;&gt;Ruslan Alikhamov&lt;/a&gt; shares how the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://qonto.com/en?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_31_23&quot;&gt;Qonto&lt;/a&gt; managed to reduce the test build and run times on CI/CD by around 37% 🤯.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/r_alikhamov&quot;&gt;Ruslan Alikhamov&lt;/a&gt; does a brilliant job at explaining the problem they were facing, the different approaches they took to solve it, and the results they achieved. I am going to be taking some of the learnings from this article and applying them to my projects ❤️.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twentieth issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep my intro short and sweet this time as my focus these past two weeks hasn&apos;t been as much on CI/CD and automation as it usually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been doing a lot of SwiftUI both at work and for my side projects. I have been playing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1675882601263820802&quot;&gt;the new iOS 17+ MapKit and SwiftUI APIs&lt;/a&gt;, which are amazing, building a reusable settings form component to build data-backed screens from scratch at work and, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1679808155092496385&quot;&gt;looking into workarounds for the quirks and inconsistencies across SwiftUI in different iOS versions&lt;/a&gt; 😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning on writing some interesting articles about the things that I have been building over the next few weeks on my blog, so make sure to keep an eye on that if you&apos;re interested in finding out more! 👀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger&quot;&gt;Marco Eidinger&lt;/a&gt; shows us how to use a &lt;code&gt;netrc&lt;/code&gt; file in Xcode Cloud runners to &lt;strong&gt;store credentials&lt;/strong&gt; that can then be used by SPM to download &lt;strong&gt;private or internal binary releases&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco also wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.eidinger.info/xcode-133-supports-spm-binary-dependency-in-private-github-release?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2020%26utm_content%3Djuly_16_23&quot;&gt;an article last year&lt;/a&gt; about solving the same problem in &lt;strong&gt;GitHub Actions workflows&lt;/strong&gt;, which you might find useful too 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albertodebo&quot;&gt;Alberto de Bortoli&lt;/a&gt; has recently open-sourced &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/albertodebortoli/EC2macConnector&quot;&gt;EC2macConnector&lt;/a&gt;, a command-line tool developed in Swift that simplifies the process of connecting to &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 Mac&lt;/strong&gt; instances through SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, Alberto explains how &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/albertodebortoli/EC2macConnector&quot;&gt;EC2macConnector&lt;/a&gt; works and why you should start using it to access your EC2 instances! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_al_we&quot;&gt;Alexander Weiß&lt;/a&gt; explains how the &lt;em&gt;Manage version and build number&lt;/em&gt; Xcode setting can affect the version of the SDKs an app is using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/_al_we&quot;&gt;Alexander&lt;/a&gt; also shows how you can turn the setting off both through Xcode&apos;s UI and programmatically to work around this issue 👏.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.214.0&quot;&gt;🚀 New Fastlane version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools&quot;&gt;Fastlane&lt;/a&gt; 2.214.0 is out now and it comes packed with improvements and fixes to existing actions and lanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the changes, I would like to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/20956&quot;&gt;highlight this PR&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iNekrich&quot;&gt;Vitalii Budnik&lt;/a&gt;, which adds the ability to change an App Store Connect&apos;s user&apos;s role and permissions directly from Fastlane 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;nineteenth issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I want to start the issue by talking about a topic I am passionate about and that I have been advocating for over the past few years: &lt;strong&gt;writing developer tools with Swift&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a project that is used, built and maintained by Swift developers, it makes a lot of sense to write any accompanying tooling using Swift too. Doing so can have several benefits such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Making the tooling &lt;strong&gt;easier to maintain over time&lt;/strong&gt; as it is written in a language you and your team are familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If your project is Open Source, it will make it &lt;strong&gt;easier to find contributors&lt;/strong&gt; that can help maintain the tooling as it is written in the &lt;strong&gt;same language as the project itself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Explaining how the tooling works to &lt;strong&gt;new members of the team is a lot easier&lt;/strong&gt; as they are &lt;strong&gt;familiar&lt;/strong&gt; with the language it is written in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the introduction of Swift Packages and Open Source projects such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Apple&apos;s Argument Parser&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.areweserveryet.org?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;rapid growth of Swift on the server&lt;/a&gt;, has made &lt;strong&gt;full-stack systems and tools to accompany your apps so much easier&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some big companies out there that already take advantage of writing their tools with Swift. For example, my team at the &lt;strong&gt;BBC&lt;/strong&gt; has a couple of scripts and command line tools that we use daily that are written entirely with Swift. Also, from speaking with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albertodebo?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Alberto de Bortoli&lt;/a&gt;, the Principal Software Engineer at &lt;strong&gt;Just Eat Takeaway&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albertodebo/status/1673802337175912449?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;it looks like they write most of their tooling with Swift too&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/understanding-mergeable-libraries?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;🧰 Understanding mergeable libraries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I wrote about a brand new feature announced in WWDC23: &lt;strong&gt;mergeable libraries&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the article, I show you how mergeable libraries work and how a couple of simple build settings changes can dramatically improve the &lt;strong&gt;dependency graph of a modular codebase&lt;/strong&gt; 👀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarcoEidinger/swift-package-dependencies-check?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;📦 This GitHub Action helps you keep SPM dependencies up to date!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I came across this great GitHub Action by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Marco Eidinger&lt;/a&gt; which processes your Swift Package&apos;s manifest to detect out-of-date dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action is &lt;strong&gt;highly configurable&lt;/strong&gt; and you can make it &lt;strong&gt;fail the workflow run&lt;/strong&gt; if outdated dependencies are detected or even &lt;strong&gt;automatically update such dependencies&lt;/strong&gt; for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/onmyway133/Swiftlane?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;🤩 Ready to use build utilities for your Swift scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently learnt about a pretty cool open-source project called &lt;strong&gt;SwiftLane&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;SwiftLane&lt;/strong&gt;, created and maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/onmyway133?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Khoa&lt;/a&gt;, is a collection of &lt;strong&gt;ready-to-use build utilities&lt;/strong&gt; written entirely in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can import SwiftLane as a Swift Package and use it directly in your &lt;strong&gt;Swift scripts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CLIs&lt;/strong&gt; to perform common actions such as &lt;strong&gt;building or archiving an Xcode project&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;communicating with App Store Connect&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;sending Slack messages&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/testableapple?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Alexey Alter-Pesotskiy&lt;/a&gt; shows you how to manage and modify .xcodeproj files programmatically using a ruby gem called xcodeproj. This can come in very handy to apply patches and update build settings from scripts and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/testableapple?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Alexey&lt;/a&gt; also points out in the article, if you write your scripts and command-line tools in Swift you must know that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tuistio?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Tuist&lt;/a&gt;, a popular tool created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pepicrft?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Pedro Piñera&lt;/a&gt; to automate and manage Xcode projects, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tuist/XcodeProj?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;have created a Swift version of Xcodeproj&lt;/a&gt; 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt; have recently made their project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EmergeTools/ETTrace?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2019%26utm_content%3Djuly_2_23&quot;&gt;ETTrace&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a &lt;strong&gt;simple and reliable way of profiling iOS applications&lt;/strong&gt; from the command line, available through SPM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, they explain the process of migrating &lt;strong&gt;from a CocoaPods-based project to an SPM one&lt;/strong&gt; and share some of the challenges they have faced along the way. They also include a section on how they &lt;strong&gt;leverage the power of CI/CD to automate their signing and distribution process&lt;/strong&gt; ❤️!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;eighteenth issue&lt;/strong&gt; of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope
you&apos;ve had a great couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent the past week trying out new features announced in WWDC such as &lt;strong&gt;macros&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Xcode Cloud and App Store Connect API advancements&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Swift Data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that so far &lt;strong&gt;I am very impressed&lt;/strong&gt;! It all looks very exciting and I can&apos;t wait to get the app at work building on Xcode 15. I think I will start looking into it next week and report my findings in the next issue of the newsletter, so keep your eyes peeled 👀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;❓ What about you? Have you already tried to build your app at work on Xcode 15? If so, what issues you have found?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/version-specific-package-manifests?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;📦 Try new SPM features with version-specific manifests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift 5.9, which ships with the Xcode 15 betas announced at WWDC 2023, comes with new SPM features such as &lt;strong&gt;macro targets&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;new permissions for command plugins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this week&apos;s article on my blog, I show you how you can safely try these new features out &lt;strong&gt;without breaking backward compatibility&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog-proxy.bitrise.io/post/bitrise-announces-mobile-devops-summit-2023?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;📢 Mobile DevOps Summit is back!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt; has recently announced that the Mobile DevOps Summit is retaking place this year on the &lt;strong&gt;4th and 5th of October&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended and spoke at last year&apos;s edition and I would thoroughly recommend it if you&apos;re interested in topics such as mobile CI/CD, automation and testing. You can register for the event &lt;a href=&quot;https://summit.bitrise.io?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and, if you have a topic in mind you&apos;d like to speak about, &lt;a href=&quot;https://summit.bitrise.io/page/2783513/call-for-papers?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;the Call For Papers is now open too&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roger.ml/p/emerge-linkmaps?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;👀 Uploading link maps to Emerge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;Emerge&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing service that can help you improve your app in a number of ways. You can do things such as seeing how much your &lt;strong&gt;app size&lt;/strong&gt; has varied from one build to another or profile how long it takes for your app to &lt;strong&gt;launch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Emerge&apos;s more advanced features require you to upload linkmaps for your app. In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rogerluan_&quot;&gt;Roger Oba&lt;/a&gt; shows you how you can generate these linkmaps using Fastlane and Xcode and upload them to Emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanaschita&quot;&gt;Natascha Fadeeva&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent resource if you want to &lt;strong&gt;get started with CI/CD&lt;/strong&gt;. It goes through &lt;strong&gt;what CI/CD is&lt;/strong&gt; and the core concepts behind it, &lt;strong&gt;what role it plays in iOS app development&lt;/strong&gt; and some of the most common &lt;strong&gt;CI/CD tools available&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.runway.team/blog/comparing-the-top-pre-production-and-beta-app-distribution-tools?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;📱 Comparing build distribution services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re an iOS developer you will have most likely used &lt;strong&gt;TestFlight&lt;/strong&gt; to distribute builds of your app with testers but did you know there are other services available that might be a better match for your needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GabrielSavit&quot;&gt;Gabriel Savit&lt;/a&gt; shares a great comparison of &lt;strong&gt;build distribution systems available&lt;/strong&gt;, including one that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RunwayTeam&quot;&gt;Runway&lt;/a&gt; has recently launched ✨.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.213.0?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;✍️ Fastlane 2.213.0: Run Xcode 14.3 with Rosetta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcode 14.3 &lt;strong&gt;dropped support for running Xcode with Rosetta&lt;/strong&gt; but there is still an option to run an app on &lt;strong&gt;Rosetta simulators&lt;/strong&gt; (as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sarunw&quot;&gt;Sarun&lt;/a&gt; greatly explains &lt;a href=&quot;https://sarunw.com/posts/open-using-rosetta-in-xcode-14-3?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;in this article&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an issue where Fastlane would &lt;strong&gt;not allow users to make use of this option&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;scan&lt;/strong&gt; command but, as is usually the case, the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshdholtz&quot;&gt;Josh Holtz&lt;/a&gt; came up with a fix for it and shipped it in version &lt;strong&gt;2.213.0&lt;/strong&gt;! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;d like to learn more about how this new &lt;strong&gt;Fastlane flag&lt;/strong&gt; works or how you can achieve the same result using &lt;strong&gt;xcodebuild&lt;/strong&gt; directly, I would thoroughly recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roger.ml/p/run-xcodebuild-using-rosetta-xcode-14-3?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2018%26utm_content%3Djune_18_23&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rogerluan_&quot;&gt;Roger Oba&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;WWDC special&lt;/strong&gt; issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you&apos;ve all enjoyed Apple&apos;s Developer Conference and are looking forward to trying out all the &lt;strong&gt;new features and APIs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this special edition of the newsletter, I will be sharing my favourite WWDC sessions on CI/CD and developer tooling along with some great content from the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main CI/CD highlight of this year&apos;s edition of Apple&apos;s Developer Conference for me is the fact that &lt;strong&gt;Xcode Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; now allows you to automatically set &lt;strong&gt;TestFlight test notes for beta builds&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a feature I have long been waiting for, and I got so excited when it was announced that I had to try it out and &lt;strong&gt;write an article on the topic&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also very excited to dive into &lt;strong&gt;Swift macros&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;visionOS&lt;/strong&gt;, the exciting &lt;strong&gt;mergeable libraries&lt;/strong&gt; and all of the &lt;strong&gt;UIKit&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/strong&gt; improvements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;❓What&apos;s your WWDC highlight? Reach out to me on Twitter or reply to this email with what you&apos;re most excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in the introduction, the ability to set &lt;strong&gt;test notes directly on Xcode Cloud builds&lt;/strong&gt; is a feature I have long been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so excited when Jason Wu and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/myChrisDangelo?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2017%26utm_content%3Djune_11_23&quot;&gt;Chris D&apos;Angelo&lt;/a&gt; announced the feature in their session &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10224?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2017%26utm_content%3Djune_11_23&quot;&gt;Simplify distribution with Xcode and Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt; that I had to test it out and write an article about it right away. If you want to learn how to &lt;strong&gt;automatically generate, translate and set test notes&lt;/strong&gt; on Xcode Cloud beta builds this is the article for you 💪.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the pros and cons of &lt;strong&gt;static&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt; libraries is important for making informed decisions on how to link libraries in your application. Choosing one or the other might have an impact on things such as your &lt;strong&gt;app&apos;s size&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;launch time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CyndyIshida?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2017%26utm_content%3Djune_11_23&quot;&gt;Cyndy Ishida&lt;/a&gt; introduces a new type of library that combines the best of both static and dynamic libraries called &lt;strong&gt;mergeable libraries&lt;/strong&gt; 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;sixteenth&lt;/strong&gt; issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you&apos;ve all had a fantastic couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, I have been working on creating Swift Packages with code that is shared (and currently duplicated) across multiple products and teams in the organisation I work for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not something we have done before as we have only ever depended on either &lt;strong&gt;local or public Swift Packages&lt;/strong&gt; and it has definitely been a formidable challenge to solve given our requirements on CI runners and how &lt;strong&gt;little access we want to give them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a neat solution which gives the runner enough access for the current workflow only using &lt;strong&gt;token-based authentication&lt;/strong&gt; while still keeping &lt;strong&gt;ssh-based auth for local development&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep an eye on my social media and my blog if you are interested as I will be writing an article about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/flexible-continuous-integration-for-ios-4ab33ea4072f?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2016%26utm_content%3Dmay_21_23&quot;&gt;🔁 Airbnb&apos;s CI/CD migration to AWS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this great article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michaelbachand&quot;&gt;Michael Bachand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/xianwen1014&quot;&gt;Xianwen Chen&lt;/a&gt; take us through why and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AirbnbEng&quot;&gt;Airbnb&lt;/a&gt; has moved their iOS CI/CD away from non-virtualised physical macOS runners to scalable EC2 macOS instances in AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This great article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantisom/&quot;&gt;Grant Isom&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nektos/act&quot;&gt;Act&lt;/a&gt;: a command-line tool made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nektos&quot;&gt;Casey Lee&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to run GitHub Actions workflows locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act can help you test your GitHub Actions directly from your terminal to tighten the feedback loop and can even help you replace some of your current scripts with local GitHub Actions workflow runs! 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitrise.io/blog/post/transitioning-your-mobile-apps-from-intel-to-apple-silicon?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2016%26utm_content%3Dmay_21_23&quot;&gt;🏛️ Getting your app ready for Apple silicon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-14_3-release-notes#Deprecations&quot;&gt;As of version 14.3, running Xcode under Rosetta is no longer supported on Apple Silicon machines&lt;/a&gt;. If you are still struggling to get your app to run on Apple Silicon simulators due to the new arm64 slice, this article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt; can help you out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are &lt;strong&gt;blocked by a third-party dependency&lt;/strong&gt; to release an update with support for Apple Silicon and you don&apos;t want to wait anymore, I would suggest checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://bogo.wtf/arm64-to-sim.html?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2016%26utm_content%3Dmay_21_23&quot;&gt;this amazing article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/giertler&quot;&gt;Bogo&lt;/a&gt; on how you can convert arm64 device arch slices into Apple Silicon sim-compatible ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across this cool improvement to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; mobile app. You can now edit your &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; Actions workflow files on the go directly from your iOS or Android device! 🎉📱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2023-05-04-github-actions-all-actions-will-run-on-node16-instead-of-node12?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2016%26utm_content%3Dmay_21_23&quot;&gt;❗️ Node 12 will no longer be allowed in GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the 18th of May, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; no longer allows actions to run &lt;strong&gt;Node 12.0&lt;/strong&gt;. When using Node in a workflow, it is now a requirement to use &lt;strong&gt;version 16.0 or newer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s important to know is that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/checkout&quot;&gt;@actions/checkout (v2)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact&quot;&gt;@actions/upload-artifact (v2)&lt;/a&gt; actions use Node 12.0 and you now must update to their latest versions, which use Node 16.0. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.eidinger.info/why-and-how-to-adopt-actionscheckoutv3-in-your-github-action-workflow?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2016%26utm_content%3Dmay_21_23&quot;&gt;If you want a fast and easy way of updating the version for these built-in actions on all your workflows, make sure you check out this article&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger&quot;&gt;Marco Eidinger&lt;/a&gt; wrote a while back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;fifteenth&lt;/strong&gt; issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you&apos;ve all had a fantastic couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just returned from an amazing trip to Turin where I spoke at &lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftheroes.com/2023/&quot;&gt;Swift Heroes&lt;/a&gt;. I want to take this chance to thank the organisers and all hosts for having me and for putting on such an amazing event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite thing about attending conferences is getting to know people who are passionate about app development and Swift just as much as I am (if not more) and learning from the other amazing speakers and the topics they covered in their talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have a few days to get some rest and work on the next talks I am giving at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/app-talks-manchester/events/292702430?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2015%26utm_content%3Dmay_07_23&quot;&gt;App Talks&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester and &lt;a href=&quot;https://plswift.com&quot;&gt;plSwift&lt;/a&gt; in Warsaw. Hoping to meet some of you there! 👋&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/github-action-workflows-side-effects?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2015%26utm_content%3Dmay_07_23&quot;&gt;🔁 GitHub Actions workflow side effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I wrote an article on a &lt;strong&gt;less common yet very powerful&lt;/strong&gt; way you can use GitHub Actions workflows. Specifically, I made use of the workflow_run trigger event to run a workflow based on the completion of another workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event can come in very handy to send &lt;strong&gt;real-time analytics&lt;/strong&gt; of your GitHub Actions workflow runs to an external service as I showcase in the article 📈.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/ettrace-reliable-ios-profiling-with-flamecharts?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2015%26utm_content%3Dmay_07_23&quot;&gt;🔍 ETTrace: A new tool to profile iOS apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt; have recently announced the release of yet another amazing product (they are on fire recently 🔥❤️)! This time they have published an &lt;strong&gt;Open Source CLI&lt;/strong&gt; written in Objective-C and Swift called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/EmergeTools/ETTrace&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ETTrace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLI allows you to profile your app locally directly from the command line and aims to be a &lt;strong&gt;faster&lt;/strong&gt;, more &lt;strong&gt;reliable&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;intuitive&lt;/strong&gt; alternative to Xcode&apos;s default time profiler instrument. I am yet to try it in one of my apps, but it certainly looks awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2023-04-24-github-actions-macos-13-is-now-available?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2015%26utm_content%3Dmay_07_23&quot;&gt;🆕 GitHub Actions: macOS 13 available!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; has announced that the long-awaited &lt;strong&gt;macOS 13 (Ventura) runners are now available&lt;/strong&gt;. This is great news for us iOS/macOS developers as the latest Xcode 14.3 &lt;strong&gt;can only be installed on machines running macOS 13 or later&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside this announcement, they have also made 12 core runners for macOS 12 and 13 available on a general public beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roger.ml/p/jenkins-ios-setup?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2015%26utm_content%3Dmay_07_23&quot;&gt;📖 The ultimate guide to Jenkins for iOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what most people think and despite its popularity not being at an all-time high, there are a lot of companies and developers out there using Jenkins as their main CI/CD provider in 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swift.org/continuous-integration/&quot;&gt;including Apple themselves&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that Jenkins is still a &lt;strong&gt;very valid solution for businesses&lt;/strong&gt; and, if you&apos;re looking at learning more about it or setting up the CI/CD for your iOS app with Jenkins, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rogerluan_&quot;&gt;Roger Oba&lt;/a&gt; has written an all-you-need-to-know guide about it ✨.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forums.swift.org/t/beta-testers-wanted-get-a-sneak-peek-at-github-s-code-scanning-support-for-swift/64632?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2015%26utm_content%3Dmay_07_23&quot;&gt;🔒 Try GitHub&apos;s new code-scanning support for Swift now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; has recently announced that from the 1st of June, they will be adding Swift support for their code scanning solutions. This is very exciting news as it will allow developers to &lt;strong&gt;get security alerts and warnings&lt;/strong&gt; on Swift repositories and will also &lt;strong&gt;allow Dependabot to work on Swift projects&lt;/strong&gt; 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✨ If you want to try the new changes out before June, you can &lt;strong&gt;now apply for early access&lt;/strong&gt; following the instructions on the Swift forums post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/martinjeret&quot;&gt;Martin Jeret&lt;/a&gt; announced on Twitter that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codemagicio&quot;&gt;Codemagic&lt;/a&gt; now has M2 runners available 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;fourteenth&lt;/strong&gt; issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you&apos;ve all had a fantastic couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time this issue of the newsletter goes out, I will be back in the UK after an amazing week in New York. I had an amazing time speaking about Xcode Cloud at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyswifty&quot;&gt;NYSwifty&lt;/a&gt; and spent the rest of the week exploring the city and catching up with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren&apos;t able to attend the conference in person or online, make sure you keep an eye on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyswifty&quot;&gt;NYSwifty&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s Twitter as they will publish recordings of all talks at some point. In the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pol.link/nyswifty?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2014%26utm_content%3Dapr_23_23&quot;&gt;you can download my slides&lt;/a&gt; and send me a message if you have any questions or want to discuss Xcode Cloud! ☁️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/how-to-deploy-beta-versions-of-your-app-to-testflight-and-appcenter-with-xcode-cloud?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2014%26utm_content%3Dapr_23_23&quot;&gt;☁️ Deploying beta versions using Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xcode Cloud makes it very easy to &lt;strong&gt;automate an app&apos;s deployment process&lt;/strong&gt; and can help you start uploading builds to TestFlight with &lt;strong&gt;just a few clicks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things start getting a bit more complex though if you have extra requirements such as distributing your app&apos;s beta versions to an external service such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://appcenter.ms&quot;&gt;Microsoft&apos;s AppCenter&lt;/a&gt;. Worry not though, after reading this article you will know all about deploying beta versions to both TestFlight and any external services 📦.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/swift-server/swiftly?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2014%26utm_content%3Dapr_23_23&quot;&gt;🧰 Installing and managing Swift toolchains with Swiftly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xTim&quot;&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyswifty&quot;&gt;NYSwifty&lt;/a&gt; this week on the current state of Swift on the server. During this talk, he mentioned a new project that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://swift.org/sswg&quot;&gt;Swift Server Work Group&lt;/a&gt; are currently working on: &lt;strong&gt;Swiftly&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiftly allows you to &lt;strong&gt;install and manage Swift toolchains across multiple architectures and operating systems&lt;/strong&gt;. While it is still early days in the development of the command line tool, it is now available for everyone to try and contribute to ✍️.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftyfinch.github.io/en/2023-04-22-rugby-remastered?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2014%26utm_content%3Dapr_23_23&quot;&gt;🏉 A behind-the-scenes look into Rugby&apos;s latest update&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve ever worked on a project that uses CocoaPods as a dependency manager, you will know how &lt;strong&gt;time-consuming&lt;/strong&gt; it can be to install and build pods, which can really slow down your CI workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/swiftyfinch&quot;&gt;Vyacheslav Khorkov&lt;/a&gt; came up with a command line tool called Rugby, which helps speed up the process by introducing smarter caching into the install/build process of pod dependencies. Even if you don&apos;t use CocoaPods I would thoroughly recommend reading this behind-the-scenes article on what went into making the latest Rugby update as it talks about how to solve some interesting challenges 🏉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://getstream.io/blog/linting-documentation-with-vale/#setting-vale-up-in-ci?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2014%26utm_content%3Dapr_23_23&quot;&gt;📑 Linting your documentation on CI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, I was introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://vale.sh&quot;&gt;vale.sh&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AppForce1&quot;&gt;Jeroen Leenarts&lt;/a&gt; at the Do iOS conference in Amsterdam. Ever since I have been using the tool to make sure my documentation adheres to a set of styles and standards and I am even using it to lint for tutorial-style articles on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AppForce1&quot;&gt;Jeroen&lt;/a&gt; describes why and how you would use &lt;a href=&quot;https://vale.sh&quot;&gt;vale.sh&lt;/a&gt; and, amongst many other things, how you can set up a CI/CD workflow to lint your project&apos;s documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codemagic.io/deep-dish-swift-2023?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2014%26utm_content%3Dapr_23_23&quot;&gt;🍕 Should you use CI/CD as an indie dev?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions that I get very often is whether &lt;strong&gt;it is worth setting up CI/CD workflows as an indie or solo developer&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rudrankriyam&quot;&gt;Rudrank Riyam&lt;/a&gt; is giving a talk on exactly this at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DeepDishSwift&quot;&gt;Deep Dish Swift&lt;/a&gt; next week! 🍕&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re in or around Chicago, I would thoroughly recommend attending the conference and making sure you don&apos;t miss &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rudrankriyam&quot;&gt;Rudrank&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s talk, which sounds super exciting and interesting! Furthermore, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rudrankriyam&quot;&gt;Rudrank&lt;/a&gt; has written an article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/codemagicio&quot;&gt;Codemagic&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s blog about what to expect from the conference 🤩.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wolfia.com/blog/streamlining-mobile-app-development?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2014%26utm_content%3Dapr_23_23&quot;&gt;💡A technical guide to Mobile CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wolfia_app&quot;&gt;Wolfia&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s blog, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/narenmano&quot;&gt;Naren Manoharan&lt;/a&gt; gives an excellent overview of what mobile CI/CD is and what it can be used for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would thoroughly recommend reading through this article if you&apos;re starting out with CI/CD and want to learn more about it or if you&apos;ve got experience with it but want a refresher on some of the concepts 👏.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.212.2?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2014%26utm_content%3Dapr_23_23&quot;&gt;🚀 Fastlane 2.212.2 is out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new release of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools&quot;&gt;Fastlane&lt;/a&gt; is now out with numerous improvements and bug fixes. Among some other great changes, this release includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/20738&quot;&gt;one of my contributions which makes deliver&apos;s verify_only option work out of the box again by using altool instead of the iTunes Transporter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshdholtz&quot;&gt;Josh Holtz&lt;/a&gt; for getting the release out and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/giginet&quot;&gt;@giginet&lt;/a&gt; for helping see the work through and reviewing my pull request 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;thirteenth&lt;/strong&gt; issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you&apos;ve all had a fantastic couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conference season is fastly approaching and my effort has shifted to preparing for my upcoming talks. I am very excited to travel to new places, meet new people and learn from amazing speakers and attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I thought I would start this issue by asking you a question: &lt;strong&gt;Which conferences will you be attending this year?&lt;/strong&gt; Let me know by replying to this email or reaching out to me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polpielladev&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/polpielladev&quot;&gt;Linkedin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://iosdev.space/@polpielladev&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/automating-swift-package-releases-with-github-actions?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2013%26utm_content%3Dapr_09_23&quot;&gt;📦 Automating Swift command line tool releases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this week&apos;s article in my blog, I wrote about the GitHub Actions workflow I wrote to release my command line &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/polpielladev/chatty-cli&quot;&gt;chatty&lt;/a&gt;. The article goes through how to build a Swift CLI for multiple architectures, create a GitHub release and distribute the app using Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools/status/1644026876053315584&quot;&gt;✂️ The impact of unoptimised images on an app&apos;s size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I came across another great Twitter thread by the team over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt;. This time they share their analysis of the Chevrolet mobile app and how unoptimised images were bloating their app binary size unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1644656511317078017?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2013%26utm_content%3Dapr_09_23&quot;&gt;⏭️ Skipping DocC and Xcode Cloud CI runs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently discovered that you can tell Xcode Cloud not to run for a specific commit by including [ci skip] in its title or description. When I shared this tip on Twitter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rudrankriyam&quot;&gt;Rudrank&lt;/a&gt; also &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rudrankriyam/status/1644656986229821440&quot;&gt;pointed out that this principle also applies to DocC projects&lt;/a&gt;, looks like they both must be using the same system underneath 🤔.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://asifmohd.github.io/ios/2023/03/30/reducing-ios-app-size-using-linker.html?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2013%26utm_content%3Dapr_09_23&quot;&gt;🤯 Using the -why_load linker flag to reduce app size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I learnt thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_asif0312&quot;&gt;Asif&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s great post that you can find out specifically &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; each symbol is linked to your app&apos;s binary by using the &lt;code&gt;why_load&lt;/code&gt; linker flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has inspired me to look into how the results of this linker flag can be used in a scheduled CI workflow to report the most significant findings in an easily parsable format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simonbs&quot;&gt;Simon B. Støvring&lt;/a&gt; announcing a macOS app that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Shapedk&quot;&gt;Shape&lt;/a&gt; has open-sourced: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shapehq/tartelet/wiki/Installing-Tartelet&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tartelet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The app, which Shape has been using internally for the past few months, allows its users to manage ephemeral self-hosted GitHub runners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;twelfth&lt;/strong&gt; issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you&apos;ve all had a fantastic couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce that I will be speaking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftheroes.com/2023?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;Swift Heroes&lt;/a&gt; about making developer tooling with Swift. If you&apos;re in or around Turin on the 4th and 5th of May and want to learn about all things iOS and Swift from great speakers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://swift-heroes.eventengage.app/register?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;make sure you book your early bird tickets&lt;/a&gt; while they&apos;re still available!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;🚨 New minimum Xcode version for App Store submissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple announced this week that, as of next month, all iOS and iPadOS apps submitted to the App Store &lt;strong&gt;must be built with Xcode 14.1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still using a version of Xcode older than 14.1, make sure you upgrade it on your CI runners now to &lt;strong&gt;avoid issues with your next release&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2023-03-23-we-updated-our-rsa-ssh-host-key?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;❗️ GitHub updated their RSA SSH host key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; had to update its RSA SSH host key due to a potential security threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/_mph4?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;Mike Hanley&lt;/a&gt;, their Chief Security Officer and SVP of Engineering, posted an in-depth update on GitHub&apos;s blog explaining why they needed to update this key and what the &lt;strong&gt;implications for users would be&lt;/strong&gt;. I thoroughly recommend reading it if you&apos;re seeing any errors when communicating with GitHub through SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-14_3-release-notes?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;⬆️ Xcode 14.3 requires macOS Ventura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release candidate for Xcode 14.3 was released earlier this week and, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Apple?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; stated in the release notes, &lt;strong&gt;it will only run on macOS 13 (Ventura) or later&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be a good chance to upgrade your CI runners to macOS 13 if you haven&apos;t done so yet to ensure you are ready for new versions of Xcode going forward! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/blog/m1-mac-resource-class?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;⚡️ M1 macOS runners now available on CircleCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1636004541870088193?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;tweeted about the public GitHub roadmap&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that M1 GitHub-hosted macOS runners &lt;strong&gt;will not be available until Q4 of 2023&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t want to wait that long, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CircleCI?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt; has announced that M1 runners are now available for their users! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I would like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aislingconroy?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;Aisling Conroy&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/CircleCI?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt; who shared the blog post with me. 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamesSherlouk/status/1638481217942085635?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;had a conversation on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamesSherlouk?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;James Sherlock&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/about-webhooks?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;GitHub webhooks&lt;/a&gt; following my article where I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/github-webhooks-and-xcode-cloud?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;issue comment webhook to trigger an Xcode Cloud build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JamesSherlouk?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;, he showed me that you could use pretty much any GitHub webhook as a workflow trigger. A good example of this is the workflow that &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/JamesSherlouk?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; made for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SwiftPackages?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2012%26utm_content%3Dmar_26_23&quot;&gt;Swift Package Index&lt;/a&gt; project, which automatically creates pull requests from issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Welcome to the &lt;strong&gt;eleventh&lt;/strong&gt; issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. I hope you’ve all had a fantastic couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been pretty busy over the past couple of weeks working on my talk for &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyswifty.com?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2011%26utm_content%3Dmar_12_23&quot;&gt;NYSwifty in April&lt;/a&gt;, where I will speak about Xcode Cloud. I will not only be covering the basics, but I will also show you how to tackle complex use cases and how to expand Xcode Cloud&apos;s functionalities with the use of webhooks and server-side Swift applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worry not if you can&apos;t make the talk though, as I will be posting a number of articles in the run-up to the conference on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2011%26utm_content%3Dmar_12_23&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, so make sure you keep an eye on it if you want to learn more about Xcode Cloud 👀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/managing-xcode-installs-using-fastlane?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2011%26utm_content%3Dmar_12_23&quot;&gt;🔀 Managing multiple versions of Xcode using Fastlane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently written a CI/CD related article on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2011%26utm_content%3Dmar_12_23&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and thought I would share it in this week&apos;s newsletter. As of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.211.0?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2011%26utm_content%3Dmar_12_23&quot;&gt;release of Fastlane 2.211.0&lt;/a&gt; and an awesome contribution by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rogerluan_?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2011%26utm_content%3Dmar_12_23&quot;&gt;Roger Oba&lt;/a&gt;, one of the tool&apos;s core contributors, there have been some changes to the way you select a specific Xcode version on CI using Fastlane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worry not though, I go through all the changes and what the currently available options are in my article 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2023-03-01-github-actions-introducing-faster-github-hosted-x64-macos-runners?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2011%26utm_content%3Dmar_12_23&quot;&gt;⚡️ 12-core GitHub-hosted macOS runners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; announced the introduction of new Intel-based 12-core macOS runners. This is a massive step up from their current macOS runners, which only have 3 cores available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the public beta is only available for enterprises and organisations on the team or enterprise plan at the moment. If you meet these requirements and you try the feature, let me know how you find it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xcodesapp/status/1631839127195856901&quot;&gt;🚨 An important update to the Xcodes CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last issue of the newsletter, I mentioned that Fastlane fixed a bug where Apple ID sign-in in App Store Connect could result in an account being locked out 😱.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xcodesapp&quot;&gt;Xcodes CLI&lt;/a&gt; was also impacted by this issue as it needs to authenticate with App Store Connect to download Xcode versions. Similarily to what Fastlane did, the team has taken action and released a new version that prevents this issue from happening. &lt;strong&gt;If you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xcodesapp&quot;&gt;Xcodes&lt;/a&gt; regularly, make sure you update to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RobotsAndPencils/xcodes/releases/tag/1.3.0&quot;&gt;version 1.3.0&lt;/a&gt; of the CLI&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LinemanZachary&quot;&gt;Zachary&lt;/a&gt; is a great read if you want to learn how a real-world application uses Xcode Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article goes through what the setup of &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/LinemanZachary&quot;&gt;Zachary&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s app &lt;a href=&quot;https://testflight.apple.com/join/V7z4RsXx&quot;&gt;Manny, a delightful Mastodon client&lt;/a&gt;, looks like and what workflows Xcode Cloud runs to ensure the app is swiftly and safely delivered to all its users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a Fastlane action can seem daunting at first if you&apos;ve never built one before, but I can guarantee you it&apos;s very simple and can be very powerful if you want to reuse your Fastlane code across multiple projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jsorge&quot;&gt;Jared&lt;/a&gt; goes through how to build a custom Fastlane action in great detail on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.runway.team/blog?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2011%26utm_content%3Dmar_12_23&quot;&gt;Runway&apos;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. 👏&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I discovered when I was looking at an Xcode Cloud post in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StackOverflow&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; that there is a CI/CD collective in the platform. ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just joined it and am not too sure what being part of it yet means, but if you know more about it and how to make good use of it, make sure you reach out to me on Twitter or Mastodon. 😊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋  Welcome to the tenth issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you’ve all had a fantastic couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the previous issue, we&apos;ve had a two-week sprint at work to look into how we can improve the state of our codebase. I have primarily focused on migrating 3rd-party CocoaPods dependencies to Swift Package Manager and learning the ins and outs of how the Swift build system resolves, installs, and builds its dependencies, which has been very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work inspired the article I wrote last week on my blog which I am sharing in this issue of the newsletter 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/safely-pinning-spm-depedencies-to-exact-versions?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Safely depending on exact versions of Swift Packages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I explain why it might be a good idea to pin Swift Package Manager dependencies to exact versions and how setting an xcodebuild flag on your CI builds will help ensure you get reproducible builds and mitigate security risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools/status/1629153901747265538?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;🚨 You might need to update Fastlane 🚨&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Fastlane&lt;/a&gt; has had an issue this week affecting accounts that authenticate with App Store Connect using Apple ID. This authentication method has been causing forbidden access responses that could even lock Apple ID accounts out 😱.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joshdholtz?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Josh Holtz&lt;/a&gt; came to the rescue and swiftly opened a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/21073?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; to fix the issue, which was followed shortly after with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.212.1?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;the release of version 2.212.1 of Fastlane&lt;/a&gt; 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is affecting you and your team, make sure you update to the latest version now. As Fastlane themselves recommend in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools/status/1629153901747265538?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;, consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/fastlane-appstore-connect-api-and-github-actions?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;migrating to using an App Store Connect API key as your authentication method going forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.runway.team/blog/introducing-quickstart-ci-cd-by-runway?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Quickstart CI/CD by Runway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RunwayTeam?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Runway&lt;/a&gt; has launched a new product: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.runway.team/blog/introducing-quickstart-ci-cd-by-runway?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Quickstart CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;. As its name states, this new tool allows you to create new CI/CD pipelines for iOS and Android or replace existing flaky ones automatically with just a few clicks. And the best part is that &lt;strong&gt;this new service is completely free&lt;/strong&gt;! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will know by now, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/RunwayTeam?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Runway&lt;/a&gt; sponsor this newsletter, and when they shared the news of this new service and asked me whether I wanted to feature it, I immediately said yes as it looks very exciting! Hoping to try it out on a new side project soon 🔨👀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tanaschita.com/20230213-fastlane-ios-developer-guide?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Fastlane iOS developer guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanaschita?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Natascha Fadeeva&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing resource if you&apos;re getting started with Fastlane. It shows you how you can install it, create lanes, authenticate with App Store Connect, handle code signing, and much more! 🤩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/194?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Fastlane might be moving to Mobile Native Foundation!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a big conversation on Twitter this week about Fastlane and whether it should continue being owned by Google, who don&apos;t seem to be very invested in helping to maintain the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1627315332716150785?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt;, created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/steipete?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Peter Steinberger&lt;/a&gt;, started a great conversation about how Fastlane would benefit from moving to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;Mobile Native Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. There have already been conversations off the back of the thread on making this happen along with companies wanting to sponsor the Open Source project if this migration happens. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re interested in keeping an eye on the move, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MobileNativeFoundation/discussions/discussions/194?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%2010&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_26_23&quot;&gt;the conversation is happening in this GitHub discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, I wanted to say thanks for the awesome support everyone has been showing for the iOS CI Newsletter. I&apos;m over the moon to say that we&apos;re now over &lt;strong&gt;500&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;subscribers!&lt;/strong&gt; 🎉🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, this coming week we&apos;re starting a two-week sprint at work to help us tackle tech debt and improve the state of our codebase. As part of this effort, I will be looking at replacing some &lt;strong&gt;3rd party Cocoapods dependencies with their Swift Package Manager equivalents&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also want to investigate if it&apos;s possible to commit the Swift Package Manager dependencies to source control just like we do with Cocoapods dependencies at the moment, which is going to be interesting. I will be reporting my findings both in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and in the next issue of the newsletter, wish me luck! 🤞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/using-app-store-connect-api-to-trigger-xcode-cloud-workflows?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;Using App Store Connect API to trigger Xcode Cloud workflows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the App Store Connect API has a set of endpoints to handle Xcode Cloud related tasks? In this article I show you how you can, with the help of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;appstoreconnect-swift-sdk&lt;/a&gt; Swift package, get a list of Xcode Cloud products and their workflows, which you can then trigger! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can come in incredibly useful to extend Xcode Cloud&apos;s built in functionalities by building custom triggers and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-08-pull-request-merge-queue-public-beta?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;GitHub merge queues are now on public beta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/github?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; have announced that the pull request merge feature is now available in public beta 🎉  If you&apos;re not familiar with how merge queues work, they are a way of automating merges by creating temporary branches containing the latest changes from both the target branch and any other PRs waiting in the queue. Any CI/CD checks are then run against the new temporary branch and &lt;strong&gt;only if they succeed, the branch will be merged into main&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about how to enable and use this feature in &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;GitHub&apos;s documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I&apos;m sharing another great article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/testableapple?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;Alexey&lt;/a&gt; on how to make the output of your CI&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;XCTest&lt;/a&gt; commands easier to read and parse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/xcpretty/xcpretty?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;xcpretty&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time at work and I have to say it makes it a lot easier to find failures in otherwise hard-to-read logs ✨.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading this article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dvrzan?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;Danijela&lt;/a&gt; where she shares 5 tips on how to create good pull requests. It made me think of another tip that I always keep in mind when I have to open a pull request:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the CI passes before you share the pull request with your teammates so that you don&apos;t have to push fixes again and ask for a re-review ✅.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rudrankriyam?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%209&amp;amp;utm_content=feb_12_23&quot;&gt;Rudrank&lt;/a&gt; wrote an article with a list of popular Open-Source iOS codebases. Since all their code is public, these projects provide an amazing learning resource on how apps with big codebases handle certain challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re interested in learning more about how big projects handle CI/CD, you can find some examples in the repositories listed in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋  Welcome to the eighth issue of the iOS CI Newsletter. Hope you’ve all had an amazing couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce that, from this week, the awesome people at &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.runway.team/get-started?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23&quot;&gt;Runway&lt;/a&gt; will be sponsoring the iOS CI Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the people behind a product that I personally like and with deep connections to the mobile CI/CD community to help me continue creating free content was one of my goals for the year, so I am very grateful to &lt;a href=&quot;https://get.runway.team/get-started?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23&quot;&gt;Runway&lt;/a&gt; for helping me achieve this 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/scheduling-tweets-with-github-actions-and-swift?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23&quot;&gt;Scheduling tweets using GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I wrote an article on how I use GitHub Actions to automate repetitive processes such as posting content on Twitter. This is a slightly less common way of using GitHub Actions but, since minutes are free for public repositories, it can be a great option for automating repetitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line at the heart of this scheduled task, which runs every Friday at noon, is written entirely in Swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.eidinger.info/save-money-when-using-github-actions-for-ios-cicd?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23&quot;&gt;Saving money when using GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things to consider when choosing a CI provider is pricing. In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger&quot;&gt;Marco Eidinger&lt;/a&gt; gives you a number of tips to keep your GitHub Actions bills as low as possible, or even free! 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/testableapple/status/1616522116517560322?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23&quot;&gt;iOS stress testing now from Fastlane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alteral/xcmonkey&quot;&gt;xcmonkey&lt;/a&gt;, a tool made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/testableapple&quot;&gt;Alexey Alter-Pesotskiy&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to stress test iOS apps from the command line, in the last issue of the newsletter. Since then, a new release with a Fastlane integration has come out, making stress testing your app on the CI a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools/status/1615786030627704832?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23&quot;&gt;Automated SwiftUI snapshot testing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt; are looking for SwiftUI developers to trial a new service that automates snapshot testing without having to write any code. From reading the thread, it looks like this new tool will generate SwiftUI previews and compare them against a running app, which sounds very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or the company you work for have an app written in SwiftUI I would thoroughly recommend reaching out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and asking for early access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://christiantietze.de/posts/2023/01/xcode-requires-data-connection-for-swift-package-resolution/?utm_campaign%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%26utm_medium%3Dweb%26utm_source%3DiOS%20CI%20Newsletter%20Issue%208%26utm_content%3Djan_29_23&quot;&gt;Swift package resolution and data usage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have definitely experienced the pain of the &apos;Resolve Packages&apos; step in Xcode failing when using a weak internet connection. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ctietze&quot;&gt;Christian Tietze&lt;/a&gt; came across this same issue recently and decided to monitor how much data was being requested by Xcode. He noticed that a single resolution step downloaded 45 MB of data! 😱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highlights a potential improvement you could do to reduce your CI&apos;s run times and network usage by storing Swift Package caches on your runners or even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/binary-targets-swift-package-manager/&quot;&gt;using binary targets instead to reduce dependency sizes&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twannl&quot;&gt;Antoine&lt;/a&gt; explains in his blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋  Welcome to the seventh issue of the iOS CI Newsletter! Hope you’ve all had an amazing couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am finally back in the groove of things after a long break during Christmas. I have been working hard on bringing out more articles about CI/CD on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; recently so I would thoroughly recommend keeping an eye on it if you&apos;d like to learn more about the topic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also happy to share that I have ordered the first ever iOS CI Newsletter stickers 🎉 I will be taking them with me to meetups and conferences this year, so make sure you come up to me and ask me for one when you see me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sendy.polpiella.dev/uploads/1673778455.png&quot; alt=&quot;The new iOS CI Newsletter stickers. They are die-cut stickers with the newsletter&apos;s icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/fastlane-appstore-connect-api-and-github-actions&quot;&gt;Using App Store Connect API keys in Fastlane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this week&apos;s article, I go through how to authenticate with the App Store Connect API using API keys directly from Fastlane. I decided to write a complete &apos;&lt;em&gt;all you need to know&apos;&lt;/em&gt; guide on the topic which shows the whole process: &lt;strong&gt;creating&lt;/strong&gt; an API key, &lt;strong&gt;storing&lt;/strong&gt; it in the CI, &lt;strong&gt;making&lt;/strong&gt; it available to the CI workflows, and &lt;strong&gt;using&lt;/strong&gt; it in Fastlane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://testableapple.com/note-36/&quot;&gt;Stress testing iOS apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/testableapple&quot;&gt;Alexey Alter-Pesotskiy&lt;/a&gt; introduces his brand new command-line tool called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alteral/xcmonkey&quot;&gt;xcmonkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This new tool allows you to &lt;strong&gt;stress&lt;/strong&gt; test iOS apps to make sure they behave correctly when presented with a high load of user input (e.g. pressing or swiping repeatedly on a particular screen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see this tool being very powerful when used in combination with other UI tests on CI/CD workflows and I am very excited to try it out 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kubilayerdogan.net/xctest-fixing-audio-video-ui-tests-on-your-ci-cd/&quot;&gt;Running audio/video UI tests on CI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading this article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kublaios&quot;&gt;Kubilay Erdogan&lt;/a&gt; on how to run UI tests that &lt;strong&gt;require audio output&lt;/strong&gt; in your CI provider. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/kublaios&quot;&gt;Kubilay&lt;/a&gt; explains in the article, CI providers use &lt;strong&gt;virtual machines with no sound&lt;/strong&gt; and, if you want to test features that require sound output, there is some extra setup you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.eidinger.info/test-your-command-line-tool-in-xcode&quot;&gt;Testing Swift command-line tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of a blast from the past, but I still refer to this article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MarcoEidinger&quot;&gt;Marco Eidinger&lt;/a&gt; every time I have to make a &lt;strong&gt;command-line tool&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a short and straight-to-the-point guide on how to test Swift command-line tools directly from Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyswifty/status/1613491321213259776&quot;&gt;A talk on Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for this year is to speak more about CI at conferences and share my experience on the topic. For the first time, I will be giving a talk on CI/CD at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nyswifty&quot;&gt;NYSwifty&lt;/a&gt;, specifically on how to get started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/&quot;&gt;Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt; 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are based in or around New York, I would thoroughly recommend attending the conference in April, there are a lot of amazing speakers confirmed already. If you can&apos;t attend, don&apos;t worry as all sessions will also be recorded 📹 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋  Welcome to the sixth issue of the iOS CI Newsletter! Hope you’ve all had an amazing couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, &lt;strong&gt;Happy New Year&lt;/strong&gt; everyone! Hope you have had an amazing end of 2022 and are excited and full of energy to have a great 2023. 🍾 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/looking-back-at-my-2022&quot;&gt;an article last week looking back at my 2022, what I have done and what I want to achieve in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Looking back, 2022 has been a great year for me and I am very thankful for all the support everyone has shown for the newsletter. I am excited to keep it going this year and have a lot of exciting improvements I will be making, so keep your eyes peeled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/managing-multiple-swift-versions-locally/&quot;&gt;Managing multiple Swift versions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common to support multiple versions of Swift on CI runners and, to make maintainance a breeze, your team will need a process in place to switch between such versions. In this article, I go through the approach I currently use to manage multiple versions of Swift in a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftindepth.com/articles/mobile_testing_challenges/&quot;&gt;Mobile app testing tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing is often overlooked by companies despite its crucial role in safely delivering an application to its users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tjeerdintveen&quot;&gt;Tjeerd&lt;/a&gt; does a great job of communicating the value of testing your application and explains why it is a good idea to run tests on CI before merging changes into the project&apos;s main branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mtldoc.com/swift/2022/12/23/xcframework-code-signing&quot;&gt;Code signing and XCFrameworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find articles about people solving very specific and rare issues extremely interesting. This time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/petertretyakov&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt; walks us through an issue with &lt;strong&gt;signing&lt;/strong&gt; an &lt;strong&gt;XCFramework&lt;/strong&gt; containing a C++ library and how he got around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tanaschita.com/20221226-authorizing-app-store-connect-api-requests/&quot;&gt;Authorising App Store Connect API requests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanaschita&quot;&gt;Natascha&lt;/a&gt; goes through the process of creating a &lt;strong&gt;JSON Web Token (JWT)&lt;/strong&gt; which can be used to authenticate requests made to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi&quot;&gt;App Store Connect API&lt;/a&gt;. This is a &lt;strong&gt;must read&lt;/strong&gt; article if you want to use the API to write scripts and automate App Store Connect processes. This article is a follow up on her previous article on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tanaschita.com/20221128-app-store-connect-api-quide&quot;&gt;App Store Connect API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitrise.io/blog/post/insights-v2-is-here-and-heres-what-to-expect&quot;&gt;New version of Bitrise Insights is out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt; announced a new version of their Insights service. Insights allows users to &lt;strong&gt;monitor CI/CD processes&lt;/strong&gt; to identify &lt;strong&gt;bottlenecks&lt;/strong&gt; and potential areas for &lt;strong&gt;improvement&lt;/strong&gt;. The reason I was so impressed with Insights is that, at work, we have done work to gather metrics on GitHub Actions workflows completely from scratch and Bitrise offers support for this out of the box!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the announcement of Insights 2.0, Bitrise are offering this new version for &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; until March next year! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋  Welcome to the fifth issue of the iOS CI Newsletter! Hope you’ve all had an amazing couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised, as I was writing this issue, that it is the last one I will be sending out this year. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you all so much for the support and to share that the iOS CI newsletter has over 300 subscribers now! 🎉 ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the next time you&apos;ll hear from me will be in 2023, I want to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! 🥂🎄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tanaschita.com/20221212-code-signing-and-provisioning-for-ios/&quot;&gt;Code signing and provisioning explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing and provisioning iOS apps is a process which usually causes a lot of confusion amongst developers. In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanaschita&quot;&gt;Natascha&lt;/a&gt; gives a great explanation on how the process works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://trycombine.com/posts/using-markcodable-to-generate-reports/&quot;&gt;MarkCodable reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/icanzilb&quot;&gt;Marin&lt;/a&gt; goes through how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarkCodable/MarkCodable&quot;&gt;MarkCodable&lt;/a&gt; library can be used to provide better, more readable reports from command line tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also showcases how, with just a few lines of code, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MarkCodable/MarkCodable&quot;&gt;MarkCodable&lt;/a&gt; can help improve the output of the swift tests command. I will definitely be trying it out on one of my project&apos;s CIs over the next couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kodeco.com/36548823-getting-started-with-xcode-cloud&quot;&gt;Getting started with Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&apos;t tried or looked into &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/&quot;&gt;Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt; yet, I would thoroughly recommend reading this tutorial from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jab2109&quot;&gt;Josh Berlin&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kodecodev&quot;&gt;Kodeco&lt;/a&gt;. It goes through how to setup your project to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/&quot;&gt;Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt; and how to create workflows for running the app&apos;s tests and submitting it to Testflight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twannl/status/1602295739664793601&quot;&gt;I also came across a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twannl&quot;&gt;Antoine&lt;/a&gt; this week where he asked for people&apos;s experiences with &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/&quot;&gt;Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. If you fancy hearing about how people are finding it before making the switch, I&apos;d thoroughly recommend reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/twannl/status/1602295739664793601&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simonbs/status/1602067461213413377&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions delayed macOS Ventura support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across a tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/simonbs&quot;&gt;Simon B. Støvring&lt;/a&gt; this week linking to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/6426#issuecomment-1341047365&quot;&gt;GitHub issue about the availability of macOS 13 GitHub-hosted runners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the issue, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/6426#issuecomment-1341047365&quot;&gt;a GitHub engineer confirms&lt;/a&gt; that macOS 13 (Ventura) GitHub-hosted runners will only become available on public beta in the second quarter of 2023, which unfortunately is a long time away 😔.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools/status/1603459697499000832&quot;&gt;A look at Twitter&apos;s app size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have really enjoyed reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&apos;&lt;/a&gt; tweets where they dig into live apps&apos; contents and suggest improvements they could introduce to decrease their app sizes. This week they audited the Twitter app and identified some areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋  Welcome to the fourth issue of the iOS CI Newsletter! Hope you’ve all had an amazing couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we have been very busy over the past couple of weeks making improvements to our CI pipelines and trying to reduce our app&apos;s build times. The article I have written this week for my blog stems from this work and showcases a tool we have written to track any improvements (or regressions) to the duration of our CI pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/collecting-gihub-actions-workflow-metrics-with-swift&quot;&gt;GitHub Action workflow metrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having visibility and metrics over how long each of your CI pipeline runs takes over time is very important. It allows you to spot increases (or decreases) in the duration of specific CI pipelines and quickly identify the cause for such changes to the pipeline&apos;s duration. If you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/actions&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;, you might find the tool described in this article useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tanaschita.com/20221128-app-store-connect-api-quide/&quot;&gt;App Store Connect API guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tanaschita&quot;&gt;Natascha&lt;/a&gt; takes a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/&quot;&gt;App Store Connect API&lt;/a&gt; and goes through how it can be used to automate tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write your scripts and command line tools with Swift and are looking for a Swift SDK to interact with the App Store Connect API, you can check &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AvdLee/appstoreconnect-swift-sdk&quot;&gt;this project&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twannl&quot;&gt;Antoine&lt;/a&gt; out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building-swift-packages-or-swift-playground-app-projects-with-xcode-cloud&quot;&gt;Xcode Cloud and Swift Packages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/polpielladev/status/1595144260701261824&quot;&gt;I asked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; whether it was possible to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/get-started/&quot;&gt;Xcode Cloud&lt;/a&gt; to build Swift Packages without having to link them to an app target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is that it&apos;s not technically possible, but this article from Apple shows a workaround which can be used to build a Swift Package with Xcode Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools/status/1597309580492820480?s=46&amp;amp;t=5QSuHIskiHLCWzCISbqswA&quot;&gt;Notable app size changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I came across this tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools&quot;&gt;Emerge Tools&lt;/a&gt; and I thought it was super interesting! They did an analysis of big apps which had notable size changes over that week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the tweet shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emergetools/status/1597309591196667904?s=20&amp;amp;t=nhH1hi4jl1twkEcT7ASE0g&quot;&gt;how the DoorDasher app size decreased&lt;/a&gt; after the binary symbols were stripped  ✂️. I would recommend following them on Twitter as they usually share some very interesting content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.danijelavrzan.com/posts/2022/11/xcode-configuration/&quot;&gt;Understanding XCConfig files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed reading this article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dvrzan&quot;&gt;Danijela&lt;/a&gt; about XCConfig files. If you need to provide different build settings or even environment variables for different configurations of your app, I would thoroughly recommend reading this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.bitrise.io/post/the-repeato-bitrise-verified-step-codeless-ui-testing-for-mobile-apps&quot;&gt;Repeato 🤝 Bitrise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I had not heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.repeato.app/&quot;&gt;Repeato&lt;/a&gt; before reading this post from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks very interesting. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.repeato.app/&quot;&gt;Repeato&lt;/a&gt; is a no-code tool that allows you to set up and run UI automation tests with seemlingly little effort. If you&apos;re a Bitrise user, Repeato is now a verified step you can add to your workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋  Welcome to the third issue of the iOS CI Newsletter! Hope you’ve all had an amazing couple of weeks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November has been an amazing month for me, as the response to the previous newsletters has been great and I have had the chance to speak at &lt;a href=&quot;https://do-ios.com&quot;&gt;Do iOS in Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit&quot;&gt;Mobile Devops Summit&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codementor.io/events/exploring-the-power-of-swift-beyond-app-development-fprz1hw3tl?ref=arc-sourcers&quot;&gt;Latin America Remote Job Fair&lt;/a&gt; organised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arc.dev&quot;&gt;Arc&lt;/a&gt;. I want to take this chance to thank everyone involved and say hi to all the lovely people I have met at these three events, it has been a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, it has also been a stressful month as earlier in November it was announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://getrevue.co&quot;&gt;Revue&lt;/a&gt;, the service that powered this newsletter, will be shutting down by the end of this year. This meant that I had to migrate all subscribers and issues over to a new provider. I believe it is all set up correctly now, but if you spot any issues or have any feedback, please don&apos;t hesitate to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.avanderlee.com/optimization/binary-targets-swift-package-manager/&quot;&gt;Binary Targets in Swift Package Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twannl&quot;&gt;Antoine&lt;/a&gt; gives us an insight into how binary targets work and specifically how they can come in very handy to improve your CI&apos;s performance as well as help reduce its cache size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/twannl&quot;&gt;Antoine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xTim&quot;&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://do-ios.com&quot;&gt;Do iOS&lt;/a&gt; about how long it took to build and run &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/swift&quot;&gt;swift-danger&lt;/a&gt; as a Swift package on our respective CIs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danger/swift/issues/476#issue-1024788573&quot;&gt;how pre-building it as a binary can certainly help improve performance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polpiella.dev/testing-your-release-pipeline-using-fastlane&quot;&gt;Gaining confidence in your release process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some processes, such as release pipelines, are very important but do not get run frequently, which can diminish our confidence in them. In this article, I go through how scheduled CI runs can help you spot failures early and gain confidence in such processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/how-xcode14-unintentionally-increases-app-size&quot;&gt;How Xcode 14 can increase your app size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mptop27&quot;&gt;Max Topolsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jshchnz&quot;&gt;Josh Cohenzadeh&lt;/a&gt; describe in full detail in this article, some apps packaged using Xcode 14 have seen an increase in size due to binary symbols not being stripped. If you&apos;ve encountered this do not worry because this article gives you a way to strip these binary symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go further, you might consider adding some metrics to your CI to track the size of your application over time as these fluctuations can be otherwise easy to miss. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rockbruno/SwiftInfo/blob/master/Sources/SwiftInfoCore/Providers/IPASizeProvider.swift&quot;&gt;SwiftInfo&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rockbruno_&quot;&gt;Bruno Rocha&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect example of how this can be achieved (plus it&apos;s written entirely in Swift, which is always a bonus🎉).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sowenjub.me/writes/how-i-made-my-app-73-percent-ligther/&quot;&gt;Assets and application size&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the trend of app sizes, I really enjoyed reading this article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sowenjub&quot;&gt;Arnoud Joubay&lt;/a&gt;. It goes into great detail about things you need to be aware of when sharing assets between an app and its extensions and how these might unnecessarily increase the size of your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.codemagic.io/code-signing-issues-in-xcode-14-and-how-to-fix-them/&quot;&gt;Fixing code signing issues on Xcode 14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not yet migrated your CI to Xcode 14, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rudrankriyam&quot;&gt;Rudrank&lt;/a&gt; has your back and will save you some time investigating the numerous code-signing issues you&apos;re likely to encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/crappstoreconnect2.html&quot;&gt;Making App Store Connect better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s finish up with a meme I took from a post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware&quot;&gt;Jeff Johnson&lt;/a&gt; on how the App Store Connect login flow and remember me function does not work as expected. To make the login flow slightly better (or restore the way login used to be in ASC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware&quot;&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt; has made &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lapcat/AppStoreConnect&quot;&gt;a pretty neat browser extension&lt;/a&gt; that is completely open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋  Welcome to the second issue of the iOS CI Newsletter! Hope you’ve all had a fantastic week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time this issue goes out I will already be in Amsterdam in preparation for my talk at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.revue.email/ss/c/i4W3jH19ejJsNqtlezSpO4R69qfvgSCsWNxneTb4MqEkSOkQj-uC9Ffc8hlVDIff7TsnSJN0xoHz6iOfaze1h4HFNpUF0hmms-cKuSPRNo6wCETdw3rvbQstOSebs1D3WuH7B5beq1WyjONqbVVY4Q/3qx/P5h5tvNIQYq-5TZYTDrTjA/h1/NYZ2cBiw_sZmPISUGwlWkRqKaZBuEVOf9GwFX9wXy-M&quot;&gt;Do iOS Conference&lt;/a&gt;, which I am super excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but it’s my first time in Amsterdam too, so I am going a bit earlier to explore the city. I will be there until Wednesday evening, so if you happen to be there at the same time and want to catch up with me or have any Amsterdam tips, reach out to me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.revue.email/ss/c/OvZMTmFNG_ogo9mVNMFA38qdNMSfwf3tqmOJHOsWMaGIHn6LFE3IUujNKavpafraSpokryUoqh7tYNWpPAPoIXUxG9qxYYHrow0yrZEoILZ3r0kBEvqHUblIgem6Vf5XGgsfmZpoITmVA6s_EHa7ofcadZKwTuEJMBU9RBOzvHg/3qx/P5h5tvNIQYq-5TZYTDrTjA/h2/AN1wXME4BTrBWr3MlmZqc-w3x9g6CA1QsW_bxLLfUhI&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; 💬 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/provisioning.html&quot;&gt;How to regenerate Xcode managed provisioning profiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this short post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.revue.email/ss/c/OvZMTmFNG_ogo9mVNMFA3034aL-qTl6qkUDa3K37oJcZBIiI_k7iPe3DJLGmfrvrbFv3Hpc_cuCIIaBRfcV67kAqahoPXodY4uYr-xzA4Zzd_unIeXRhJA8ewzvk0A-zpNaM1RtTA-WURhF5cKDyArOlKtAWxUnZt9FuuDT2Lx8/3qx/P5h5tvNIQYq-5TZYTDrTjA/h3/cHqFXxpbEXHWqoMMBh4Pm0P0k4K51fKf1SRKCXtJwTo&quot;&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt; talks through how provisioning profiles can be regenerated even when the ‘Automatically Manage Signing’ option is enabled in Xcode. I had no idea you could do this and it will definitely save me a lot of headaches going forward! 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GitHub action workflow trigger on tag push&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://click.revue.email/ss/c/i4W3jH19ejJsNqtlezSpO9RKu2P-ddIAbbHxtOoHM-AvOGPl1_W5TWwQ9TGZt_ihCamBktLIIb05JeXRFXsKirPBp9hXrzM0jxvW9Ik2lRonfh0rencX7EzD1fBlc_tsTB584M8ff4lT09PgqfBC1GrmwS2_q5hbSsaOLOn5qgKuEffwasWKNOWbsmlpoGs7tHU4FYSVTOX0OHVZiImIcxU-GooTVCqAwl3qgUA-nKYnTcbzfzfJt56qDoqz1W0WLHthg8ne2j8InZjCfjfVqEWWyZHKwCVuL1Rdsbzkags/3qx/P5h5tvNIQYq-5TZYTDrTjA/h7/zdCyYSEHP3VlaKcEVZRWWor-NJVs2fh_2TV6shlf9ro&quot;&gt;Running a GitHub Action workflow whenever a tag is pushed&lt;/a&gt; is straight-forward, but what if you want to run it only if the tag is on a specific branch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While GitHub does not offer out of the box support for this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.revue.email/ss/c/OvZMTmFNG_ogo9mVNMFA3xcjYSe3bvOw4WQVj_-U0Rsc9ZqXoH3Xfh8a_LsK5UOpJHHPGrHKtxnWVJMSW9aJXCMpWBeRybua-mDc18PpbUarCDrwdqjOD7sy5L5XPgaDwbdsuSAOjwnq0vHeScS2rCd6KdxX9jR4ETfFMip8Dew/3qx/P5h5tvNIQYq-5TZYTDrTjA/h8/b43cJ0BCAAUnjDm0f6eZ_Ggb29fU6vuS2qgbPV7yyww&quot;&gt;Junda&lt;/a&gt; shows us a workaround in this article 🤩.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worry not though, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://click.revue.email/ss/c/OvZMTmFNG_ogo9mVNMFA35wOifKviw2Sb6we5LJB3shhmXXbtD3zcnetPlsXF-x_cWOCpcFTySD1ulcVPQXzn9uXoAgu6RUNcqUj6ArRfk-Yb2COA6OxfkWwUfgtP1fTBT1iZjl_9_8DVgDLAx-xzj6L1c9Yh6pAv3f8b21L4r0/3qx/P5h5tvNIQYq-5TZYTDrTjA/h13/vWILGRC31TZI-Wt42-gRleMVMnGm79ppYigGPlsclI8&quot;&gt;Sarun&lt;/a&gt; explains this change in great detail and offers you an alternative way to download debug symbols directly from Xcode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! 👋 Hope you’ve all had a lovely week and welcome to the first issue of the iOS CI Newsletter 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these fortnightly issues, I’ll be gathering and sharing content from the iOS community about CI/CD, helping you stay informed and providing you with a lot of learning resources on the topic. And don’t worry, there will also be a CI-inspired meme in every issue! 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit/agenda/session/1026320&quot;&gt;Mobile Devops Summit 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to kick us off than a conference on mobile CI/CD and Devops, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit/home?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Mobile Devops Summit 2022&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference, which is taking place remotely on the 10th of November and is organised by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bitrise?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Bitrise&lt;/a&gt;, will have over 80 online sessions from some of the industry’s mobile CI experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference is free to attend (you just have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit/page/2224546/register?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;register on the conference’s site&lt;/a&gt;) and it is a great opportunity for everyone to get together and talk about mobile development and CI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Shameless plug alert 😅 - I am giving &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mobiledevops.io/summit/agenda/session/1026320?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;a talk at 1 pm&lt;/a&gt; about how scheduled workflows can help you gain confidence on your release process. My talk will feature some real-world issues iOS developers can face when releasing their applications and how these can be spotted (and fixed) well ahed of time to save you from a stressful release day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/releases/tag/2.210.0&quot;&gt;Update fastlane on your CI! 🚀&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;fastlane&lt;/a&gt; to submit builds to App Store Connect on your CI and have recently updated to Xcode 14 (or you are planning to do so), you’ll want to read this carefully 🕵️‍♂️.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of fastlane’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/deliver/?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;deliver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/pilot/?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#pilot&quot;&gt;pilot&lt;/a&gt; commands no longer work out of the box due to the fact that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/20371?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#issuecomment-1238931528&quot;&gt;iTMSTransporter command line tool&lt;/a&gt; (used by fastlane under the hood to communicate with App Store Connect) has been removed from Xcode 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two solutions available to you if you face this issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update fastlane on your CI and benefit from the awesome work &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/freddi-kit?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;freddi-kit&lt;/a&gt; has made to migrate the critical deliver and pilot commands to use altool instead. 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the command you need has not yet been migrated, worry not! You can still &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/transporter/id1450874784?mt=12&amp;amp;utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;download the Transporter app from the App Store&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/20371?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#issuecomment-1239093663&quot;&gt;environment variables to let fastlane know what its path is&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not quite something that has happened in the past couple of weeks, but since this is the first issue, I wanted to share what I think is the best resource to learn and understand the process of code signing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple have dedicated three of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;TechNotes&lt;/a&gt; to do a deep dive into this topic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3125-inside-code-signing-provisioning-profiles?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;TN-3125&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3126-inside-code-signing-hashes?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;TN-3126&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3127-inside-code-signing-requirements?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;TN-3127&lt;/a&gt;. They have really helped me make sense of the whole process and look at it from a completely different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/showcase/9831667/video/751286701&quot;&gt;Collecting project&apos;s metrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will know, NSSpain X took place in September and, from what I have heard on Twitter, lived up to all expectations! Even better, for those of us who could not make it this year, the amazing NSSpain crew have made all sessions available on Vimeo, so everyone can watch them 🤟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all the amazing sessions, I want to highlight &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicahv?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Jessica Hernández Velarde&lt;/a&gt;‘s walkthrough how &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.wallapop.com/?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;Wallapop’s&lt;/a&gt; iOS team gathered data using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/vsm/dora-metrics?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#what-are-DORA-metrics&quot;&gt;Dora metrics&lt;/a&gt; on their build and deployment process to make informed improvements and decisions, really inspiring and eye opening! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ios_memes/status/1556603881202651136&quot;&gt;Meme of the week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been setting up new CI workflows for the project I am working on this week and this tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ios_memes?utm_campaign=iOS%20CI%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&quot;&gt;ios_memes&lt;/a&gt; pretty much sums up how it’s been going! 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I got there in the end…✅&lt;/p&gt;
